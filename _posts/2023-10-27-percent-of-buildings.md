title: What does it look like if 42% of the residential buildings are gone?
description: An attempt to even begin to think about the level of destruction in Gaza right now with maps

I'll be honest: the last few weeks have been rough. For me, for the world, for the people in Palestine and Israel. There's been dead babies. And subsequent news cycles about how those babies died and who lied about it. And then a hospital got bombed and even more people died. And then news cycles about who did it but nothing about helping the people who survived it or who's families were shattered as a result.

War is horrible. It's uncontrollable. And for me, a person living in California who has never signed up for any sort of military, it's pretty incomprehensible.

The photos and videos and news reports and fake news reports or unverified news reports just keep coming. It should stop because war is terrible. It's bad for journalists, it's bad for people who just want to live their one short life in the company of family and friends. It's more often than not bad for Jews. Right now it's unimaginably bad for the people being bombed in Gaza.

I [read that the UN thinks that 42% of the residential buildings in Gaza](https://www.newarab.com/news/gaza-42-housing-units-destroyed-damaged-israel) have been destroyed. What the absolute fuck does that even mean?

I have no idea. I've never been to Gaza, I don't know how many buildings are there. I've seen pictures, and I've seen pictures of the destruction. It's horrifying.

But I do know a few American cities pretty well, the ones I've lived in at least. That would be Sacramento, New York, and San Francisco.

Since I use data visualization to better understand the world all the time, I figured I could try and use it to see what would it look like if 42% of the buildings in those cities were gone.

<strong>Fuck.</strong>

Here's all the buildings in Sacramento and what it looks like when those buildings are removed. Of course, this is not what it would actually look like. It's a visualization, it's sanitized, normalized along the horror axis. But it helps me.
