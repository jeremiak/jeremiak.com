This mobile patent war is getting ridiculous. Its more dramatic than All My
Children. I guess it took them 40 something years to get rid of that nuisance
as well. Damn, 40 years of this crazy IP WMD business, and **we'll all be
fucked**.

Major props to those only on the receiving end, particularly Google. They
didn't have many patents, because they didn't want to have to play this game.
So much for that, I suppose…
