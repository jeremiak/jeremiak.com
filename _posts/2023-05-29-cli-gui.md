title: GUIs for CLIs?

Command line tools are super useful. They often do one thing and do it very well. But the lack of point-and-click style interface means that people who don't feel comfortable on the terminal can't use the program.

But what if the CLI tools had graphic user interfaces? CLIs with GUIs. That sounds kinda nice.

I'm not saying those developers should instead build web apps. I'm just wondering if there's a way we can bundle command line tools with something that allows more people to use them.

I've been wondering this for a while, since at least September 2019 when I created [`cli-gui`](https://github.com/jeremiak/cli-gui), a project that has just sat on my Github accuring Digital Ocean bills since then even though I never wrote about it until now. 

And I started thinking about it again this week when two things happened:

1. A colleague needed some help downloading a copy of a website.
2. I came across [textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), a very cool Python library for building "text user interfaces", through one of the many [Changelog podcast](https://changelog.com/) feeds.

There are _so many_ tools that are only available as CLI programs. Here's a short, and obviously unexhaustive, list of the ones that come to mind:

1. [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) - All purpose video manipulation
2. [`sherlock`](https://sherlock-project.github.io/) - Searching user names across many social networks
3. [`youtube-dl`](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) - Download videos from YouTube
4. [`mapshaper`](https://mapshaper.org/) - All purpose geographic data manipulation
5. [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) - Download a copy of a website

Since then I have been wondering if there is a way we can create a configuration file that would take any of these tools and allow an interface to be scaffolded? Even though these tools do widely different things they all work on similar principles: they take options and arguments and then output something, usually to standard out or to a file.

The `cli-gui` project was my first go at a framework for wrapping command-line tools in more friendly form fields. It used a `config.js` file to determine what fields were created for specific tools and attempted to use Docker as a way to reliably and safely run scripts. I haven't really touched Docker since and I'm not completely sure it's all that "safe" - I just make websites and do data journalism, I don't really know how computers work. From my limited perspective, we tricked rocks into thinking and, honestly, maybe it was a mistake.

The `sherlock` tool takes a single argument with no flag, just the username to search. Here's what the generated interface looks like for that tool:

As you can see in the animated GIF above, `cli-gui` was set up to allow a user to provide a single parameter to `sherlock` with the label "Enter username for search query". Here's what the configuration looks like to create that UI and the corresponding [documentation](https://github.com/jeremiak/cli-gui#adding-a-cli-tool):

```js
{
   id: 'sherlock',
   image: 'sherlock:latest',
   description: 'Sherlock is a tool for searching for a username across many social networks (<a href="https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock">website</a>)',
   fields: [
     {
       name: 'username',
       label: 'Enter username for search query',
       defaultValue: '',
       type: 'string',
     },
   ],
   format: (fields) => {
     const { username } = fields
     return username
   }
 }
 ```

The idea is that you can have a set of fields, defined in the `fields` array and in this case just `username` which is a string, and a function that accepts all of those fields and formats the text to pass to the command-line tool without it's name. In this case, the command that gets executed for a `username` of "jeremiak" is "sherlock jeremiak". The function provides flexibility to take any number of fields and format them appropriately for the underlying tool.

JavaScript is my [go to language](/blog/deno-by-default/), the first one I reach for. And the major reason is because I know it but a feature that keeps me hooked is that you can express yourself in many different patterns: objects, functions, promises, or even streams. And that last one was super useful for `cli-gui` because I can stream the results of the tool straight to the browser as it runs. Neat.

Reading through the code for `cli-gui` has me scratching my head and I'm shaking it looking at the interface. I definitely don't think _this_ is the thing that's going to make command line utilities easier to run. But I still like some of the core ideas even four years later and I still have a need for it.
