There are some truly amazing and smart people in technology, and I’m not sure
that the concentration is different from other math, science and engineering-
based fields. The attitude, however, is something that I find to be completely
unique.

The first aspect of tech start-up culture that I have come to love and
appreciate is a complete disregard for the status quo. Allow me to rephrase, a
disregard for the status quo when the normal procedure results in frustration.
If a pain point exists, the question asked is not “_why_ does it exist?” but
“_how_ can we erase it?” The existence of a problem simply means the quest for
a solution must begin.

The next question would be, “_how_ can one fix this problem?” In the tech
scene of 2011, where the costs of raw components to build amazingly powerful
tools have become negligible (an AWS instance, a [few smart
people](http://blog.getsocialize.com/meet-the-team) and LOTS of
[coffee](http://www.DanielOdio.com/2011/07/16/burr-grinder-coffee-
adventures/)) that question can more easily be answered. And its not just
being answered conceptually, products are being built that erase pain points
everyday.

This attitude translates into intense and frequent optimism; optimism that
spills over into many aspects of life. I find it to be why working at a tech
startup is so jovial and fun. I believe that there is no better time to work
in technology and in San Francisco than today.

Except, maybe tomorrow.
