WEBVTT
00:00.000 --> 00:17.600
The Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments will come to order.
00:17.600 --> 00:22.100
In response to the COVID-19 emergency, and it still is with us and to protect the public
00:22.100 --> 00:28.280
legislators and employees, we must limit non-essential gatherings and adhere to social distancing
00:28.280 --> 00:30.480
and face covering guidelines.
00:30.480 --> 00:35.720
In compliance with those orders, the Senate has made necessary adjustments to normal practices
00:35.720 --> 00:40.320
in order to ensure that the public continues to have access to the legislative process.
00:40.320 --> 00:46.520
We are holding our committee hearing in the O Street Building in room 2200.
00:46.520 --> 00:49.320
In the committee room joining me today is Senator Newman.
00:49.320 --> 00:51.240
Welcome Senator Newman.
00:51.240 --> 00:56.680
We also have joining us the California Secretary of State, Dr. Shirley Weber, representatives
00:56.680 --> 01:01.880
from the Legislative Analysts Office, the Fair Political Practice Commission, and organizations
01:01.880 --> 01:06.840
who typically use the Cal Access, and I'm going to explain to those who are new to this
01:06.840 --> 01:13.440
process what Cal Access means, to file and organize data in the system.
01:13.440 --> 01:19.040
There will be two remote participants, Stacey Owens representing the California Political
01:19.040 --> 01:25.240
Treasures Association and Daniel Newman representing MapLite.
01:25.240 --> 01:29.320
For our remote participants, please mute your phones or computers.
01:29.320 --> 01:32.720
This will greatly aid in eliminating any acoustic feedback.
01:32.720 --> 01:36.440
I ask that every time you wish to be recognized that you use the raise your hand feature in
01:36.440 --> 01:38.320
the program.
01:38.320 --> 01:41.640
Each time you are recognized to speak, a pop up window will appear asking if you'd like
01:41.640 --> 01:42.640
to unmute.
01:42.640 --> 01:45.680
Please unmute before you begin speaking.
01:45.680 --> 01:49.760
Our IT personnel will put you back on mute when you're done.
01:49.760 --> 01:53.560
Once recognized to speak, please make sure you can be seen on the screen, state your
01:53.560 --> 01:56.720
name, and then you're ready to address the committee.
01:56.720 --> 02:00.800
To allow the public access, we've admitted members of the public into the hearing room
02:00.800 --> 02:05.560
to the extent that social distancing requirements allow, and we'll be using a teleconference
02:05.560 --> 02:08.880
service for those individuals who wish to testify today.
02:08.880 --> 02:14.000
For all individuals wishing to provide public comment, the participant toll free number
02:14.000 --> 02:16.880
and access code is posted on our committee website.
02:16.880 --> 02:20.600
It will be displayed on the screen, and I will announce it now.
02:20.600 --> 02:31.920
Today's participant number is 877-226-8163, and the access code is 736-2834.
02:31.920 --> 02:37.200
For detailed instructions on how the teleconference system works, please refer to the Senate Committee
02:37.200 --> 02:39.880
website.
02:39.880 --> 02:43.400
For today's hearing, we'll be hearing all the witnesses on the agenda prior to taking
02:43.400 --> 02:45.040
any public comment.
02:45.040 --> 02:48.320
Once we've heard all the witnesses, we'll have a public comment period for those who
02:48.320 --> 02:51.480
wish to comment on today's agenda's topic.
02:51.480 --> 02:55.400
Please note that in order for us to hear you clearly and to avoid acoustic feedback, you
02:55.400 --> 02:58.960
must mute the device you are watching the hearing on prior to giving testimony over
02:58.960 --> 02:59.960
the phone.
02:59.960 --> 03:03.640
It's important that we hear from you, and we thank you for your patience.
03:03.640 --> 03:08.120
I will maintain decorum during the hearing as is customary, and any individual who is
03:08.120 --> 03:12.600
disruptive may be removed from the remote meeting service or have their connections
03:12.600 --> 03:13.600
muted.
03:13.600 --> 03:19.840
Okay, I got the border plate out of the way.
03:19.840 --> 03:24.760
So this morning's hearing, we will be examining the ongoing struggles and challenges as it
03:24.760 --> 03:29.800
relates to the CAL access system and the CAL access replacement system, which is known
03:29.800 --> 03:31.360
as CARS.
03:31.360 --> 03:36.960
But for the uninitiated, let me, it's a great trivia question, what does CAL access mean?
03:36.960 --> 03:41.040
I'm not going to ask anybody here in the room, so you're not going to be put on the spot.
03:41.040 --> 03:47.160
But it stands for the California Automated Lobby Activity and Campaign Contribution and
03:47.160 --> 03:52.520
Expenditure Search System, the first letter of all those words commonly referred to as
03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
CAL access.
03:53.520 --> 03:58.080
So, Lobby Activity Campaign Expenditure Disclosure.
03:58.080 --> 04:03.160
But you know, before we get into this topic in a great depth, I wanted to begin with some
04:03.160 --> 04:04.960
notes of appreciation.
04:04.960 --> 04:10.160
I've always been an admirer of history and what that has taught us and those who were
04:10.160 --> 04:13.800
involved in the work that we stand on their shoulders for.
04:13.800 --> 04:20.880
And I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to Senator Carnett, who in 1997 recognized
04:20.880 --> 04:27.160
that greater disclosure and transparency in lobbying and campaigns was a good thing and
04:27.160 --> 04:34.040
passed legislation that began what became the CAL access system in the year 2000.
04:34.040 --> 04:41.480
It wasn't too long into that implementation that it became clear that the system was struggling
04:41.480 --> 04:49.520
and needed upgrades and improvements, according to, I think it was the Assembly Elections
04:49.520 --> 04:51.200
Committee Analysis.
04:51.200 --> 04:57.960
In 2011, the system went down for an entire month.
04:57.960 --> 05:05.160
So in second note of appreciation goes to Senator Yee, who in 2013 recognizing this
05:05.160 --> 05:11.480
problem asked that a feasibility study be done to figure out what we can do to improve
05:11.480 --> 05:12.480
the system.
05:12.480 --> 05:17.400
Unfortunately, his legislation, which did pass the legislature, was vetoed by Governor
05:17.400 --> 05:24.880
Brown, our friend, who felt that it was, quote, costly and unnecessary, not to give
05:24.880 --> 05:32.440
up Senator Lara, our current insurance commissioner, authored legislation in 2014 to rebuild the
05:32.440 --> 05:33.840
system.
05:33.840 --> 05:39.320
It passed the legislature, but was also vetoed by Governor Brown, who felt that there were
05:39.320 --> 05:45.040
other projects that were ongoing in the Secretary of State's office that were more important,
05:45.040 --> 05:48.680
though he acknowledged that the system had its problems.
05:48.680 --> 05:56.280
Third, I want to acknowledge and give appreciation to then Secretary of State, Alex Padilla,
05:56.280 --> 06:03.960
who in 2015 initiated on his own a new function in Cal Access called the Power Search Function,
06:03.960 --> 06:10.200
which allowed individuals to be able to look at individual data combined together.
06:10.200 --> 06:14.880
So you could see who was giving to multiple candidates rather than just the flat who gave
06:14.880 --> 06:16.720
at this one point in time.
06:16.720 --> 06:22.280
And I think there was a lot of appreciation for then Secretary of State's Padilla as initiative
06:22.280 --> 06:26.600
in providing that enhanced function.
06:26.600 --> 06:29.840
Which brings us to 2016.
06:29.840 --> 06:37.400
Senator Hertzberg, with the co-authorship of the Secretary of State, Alex Padilla, passed
06:37.400 --> 06:45.560
legislation that was eventually signed by the Governor to provide a significant enhancement
06:45.560 --> 06:47.920
in the Cal Access system.
06:47.920 --> 06:54.040
At the time, Secretary of State Alex Padilla called Cal Access, quote, at Frankenstein's
06:54.040 --> 07:02.560
monster of code, unquote, that is in need of, quote, a complete rebuild, unquote.
07:02.560 --> 07:09.920
In the assembly analysis in 2016 of Senator Hertzberg's bill, they quoted the Secretary
07:09.920 --> 07:16.320
of State's office and said that the existing system, which is what we have today, this
07:16.320 --> 07:24.400
is in 2016, is fueled by a complex array of computer applications written in 14 different
07:24.400 --> 07:31.600
programming languages, including hardware, firmware, and software.
07:31.600 --> 07:36.720
Some no longer supported by their vendor that are beyond their useful age.
07:36.720 --> 07:38.800
This is in 2016.
07:38.800 --> 07:45.560
As a result, the Cal Access system has denied public access, gone offline, and put strain
07:45.560 --> 07:47.960
on the Secretary of State's staff resources.
07:47.960 --> 07:54.160
In November 2011, and they repeat the fact that I shared earlier, the system went down
07:54.160 --> 07:57.040
for most of the month of December.
07:57.040 --> 08:01.720
Thank you to, I think it was Nicole Becker from the Assembly Elections Committee for
08:01.720 --> 08:04.600
the work that she did in that analysis.
08:04.600 --> 08:12.440
So it brought us to what we're examining today, which was SB 1349 by Senator Hertzberg.
08:12.440 --> 08:19.800
And Senator Hertzberg, no reason to say what was obvious then and now.
08:19.800 --> 08:23.120
He says this about Cal Access.
08:23.120 --> 08:27.760
He says, transparency is crucial to a vibrant democracy.
08:27.760 --> 08:33.040
California was once at the forefront of providing transparency when it launched Cal Access in
08:33.040 --> 08:34.040
2000.
08:34.040 --> 08:38.360
So voters could find campaign finance and lobbying disclosures online.
08:38.360 --> 08:43.320
But it has not been significantly changed or upgraded since, and it's now an antiquated
08:43.320 --> 08:48.960
user unfriendly system that is unstable and prone to outages.
08:48.960 --> 08:53.440
Senator Hertzberg argued that his measure would bring the latest technology to make
08:53.440 --> 08:55.800
it quick and easy to search.
08:55.800 --> 09:02.320
And in that year, he pursued funding through the budget for the system to be upgraded and
09:02.320 --> 09:09.360
was able to begin the successful funding of that system improvement.
09:09.360 --> 09:17.040
At that time, the assessment of the cost of this upgrade or this rebooting of Cal Access
09:17.040 --> 09:22.120
according to the Assembly Appropriations Committee analysis was, the Secretary of State said
09:22.120 --> 09:29.520
the cost would be $11.6 million to develop, test, and implement the new system and ongoing
09:29.520 --> 09:34.240
cost of $2.8 million related to operating and maintaining the system.
09:34.240 --> 09:39.480
And that legislation, as I think I mentioned, passed with no votes.
09:39.480 --> 09:47.600
And the specific direction in that legislation was that it would be operational in 2019.
09:47.600 --> 09:52.240
They gave the room for the Secretary to delay, I think up to six months if they felt the
09:52.240 --> 09:56.920
system wasn't ready to go in 2019.
09:56.920 --> 10:01.680
So as we know, that did not come to be.
10:01.680 --> 10:10.400
I asked our wonderful Senate elections consultant to get the data points on how much expenditures
10:10.400 --> 10:14.880
were happening when this system was established and what it is today, and I wanted to share
10:14.880 --> 10:26.880
that with you, that in 2001 and 2002, there was $613 million in campaign expenditures
10:26.880 --> 10:37.200
and it came from 549,000 individual entities, $613 million.
10:37.200 --> 10:45.920
When Senator Hertzberg's legislation was passed in 2016, we were up to $1.5 billion in campaign
10:45.920 --> 10:48.000
expenditures.
10:48.000 --> 11:01.120
And today, in the 21-22 year, we had $2.3 billion in campaign expenditures from 1.389
11:01.120 --> 11:03.000
million contributors.
11:03.000 --> 11:09.080
So from when the system was first envisioned and implemented, we've had almost a four-fold
11:09.080 --> 11:16.280
increase in campaign contributions and we've had a tripling of individual donors that this
11:16.280 --> 11:18.400
system is supposed to track.
11:18.400 --> 11:25.000
So I thought that was an interesting bit of factoids that put things in perspective.
11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
So we do know that the Secretary made a decision in 19 to delay, and the current Secretary
11:34.000 --> 11:41.560
Weber made a thoughtful decision in 2021 that the system was not ready to be implemented.
11:41.560 --> 11:45.080
All the work that had been done was for naught.
11:45.080 --> 11:51.640
This of course comes after the legislature allocated and the project had spent over $30
11:51.640 --> 11:54.140
million.
11:54.140 --> 11:59.120
So it's my hope that this hearing today from the Secretary and from various stakeholders
11:59.120 --> 12:07.480
will give us an update as to what happened, why was the system not able to be implemented,
12:07.480 --> 12:12.200
what were the shortcomings at that time that did not allow it to go forward.
12:12.200 --> 12:16.320
I know there is a plan for how we're going to try to do it better, and I'm sure the Secretary
12:16.320 --> 12:19.280
will speak to that.
12:19.280 --> 12:21.720
But this perspective is important to us.
12:21.720 --> 12:30.920
The legislature, we've passed this requirement, again, unanimous votes by partisan, provided
12:30.920 --> 12:34.520
the money, and yet it's still not in place.
12:34.520 --> 12:37.360
So we're going to hear from the Secretary, we're going to hear from the Legislative
12:37.360 --> 12:41.200
Analysts Office, we're going to hear from the Fair Political Praxis Commission, which
12:41.200 --> 12:48.440
have been partners in this ongoing effort to make these changes, and with many other
12:48.440 --> 12:50.920
stakeholders, which I know will bring us important perspective.
12:50.920 --> 12:55.880
I want to again welcome and thank Senator Newman from our committee for joining me today.
12:55.880 --> 12:58.800
I want to give him the opportunity to make any opening remarks.
12:58.800 --> 13:01.560
Thank you, Mr. Chair, good morning everybody.
13:01.560 --> 13:02.880
So nice to see everyone.
13:02.880 --> 13:07.880
I had no idea CalX had such a cult following here in the Capitol.
13:07.880 --> 13:13.720
So we are today exercising our oversight obligation, something I think we don't do often enough.
13:13.720 --> 13:16.080
I commend the Chair for doing that.
13:16.080 --> 13:19.560
Welcome, Secretary Weber, welcome to your staff.
13:19.560 --> 13:27.920
And as the Chair has delineated at CalX, this is a very important repository and tool that
13:27.920 --> 13:29.400
gets used in many ways.
13:29.400 --> 13:34.680
Today's product is the result of a bunch of statutory initiatives, the work of successive
13:34.680 --> 13:41.000
secretaries of state, appreciate the burden you inherited, Secretary Weber.
13:41.000 --> 13:45.720
But as the analysis and as the Chair's statements make clear, there have clearly been issues
13:45.720 --> 13:51.480
related to the operation of the legacy systems, and the current challenge is how to then overlay
13:51.480 --> 13:57.080
a new system on top of that, and I appreciate just how challenging that is.
13:57.080 --> 14:02.560
And that's what we're here today to discuss, how to do that expediently, and effectively
14:02.560 --> 14:07.800
I'm particularly interested in the FPPC's input today about how we not only currently
14:07.800 --> 14:12.400
solve the current problem while ensuring transparency and accountability per all of the work that
14:12.400 --> 14:17.880
went into this, but also ensuring that in the future we can update the system and improve
14:17.880 --> 14:21.440
it and ensure continuity and ease of operation.
14:21.440 --> 14:23.480
So with that, thank you to the Chair.
14:23.480 --> 14:25.160
Thank you for everybody for being here.
14:25.160 --> 14:29.160
I will note that among the people who are not here is Senator Hertzberg, who is I guess
14:29.160 --> 14:33.000
technically still a member of this August body, but has termed out, appreciate all the
14:33.000 --> 14:35.640
work that he has done in this area, and other places.
14:35.640 --> 14:41.440
So you're left with the two of us, Senator Leyva, Senator Nielsen also would be here,
14:41.440 --> 14:44.120
but are moving on to new phases in their lives.
14:44.120 --> 14:49.000
So glad to be here today looking forward to the conversation, and this is an important
14:49.000 --> 14:51.520
issue that we need to drill down on.
14:51.520 --> 14:52.760
So thank you, Mr. Chair.
14:52.760 --> 14:53.760
Terrific.
14:53.760 --> 14:54.760
Thank you, Senator Newman.
14:54.760 --> 14:58.680
Well, first we want to welcome to the committee hearing room our Secretary of State, Dr. Shirley
14:58.680 --> 14:59.680
Weber.
14:59.680 --> 15:06.760
Dr. Weber, you've had a good perspective on this issue prior to your service here as our
15:06.760 --> 15:07.760
Secretary of State.
15:07.760 --> 15:11.720
You, of course, served in the Assembly, served on the Elections Committee in the Assembly.
15:11.720 --> 15:18.480
I think you heard the Hertzberg bill in 2016, so you have history on this for a lot of years,
15:18.480 --> 15:20.200
and we welcome your testimony today.
15:20.200 --> 15:22.400
Well, thank you very much.
15:22.400 --> 15:25.920
And I want to, it's red.
15:25.920 --> 15:29.080
Does it work now?
15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
Is it working?
15:30.080 --> 15:31.080
Okay.
15:31.080 --> 15:32.080
Great.
15:32.080 --> 15:33.080
Thank you.
15:33.080 --> 15:36.320
Good morning, Chair Glazier, and good morning to Senator Newman.
15:36.320 --> 15:39.440
I'm pleased to be with you here this morning.
15:39.440 --> 15:44.040
I want to thank you for the opportunity for us in SOS to come and share with you what we're
15:44.040 --> 15:49.400
doing and the challenges that we faced and we continue to face and the resolution to some
15:49.400 --> 15:51.520
of those challenges.
15:51.520 --> 15:56.200
I want to thank the Chair for allowing us to postpone the meeting that we're having
15:56.200 --> 16:01.360
today as we have to today, to the 29th, in order to deal with so many issues that we
16:01.360 --> 16:05.720
were facing, obviously, with the elections, and much of my staff totally committed to
16:05.720 --> 16:10.440
making sure that the election was fair and transparent and accurate and everything else.
16:10.440 --> 16:11.440
And we're still counting ballots.
16:11.440 --> 16:16.880
I think we still have a quarter of a million ballots to count, and the process, the more
16:16.880 --> 16:20.480
legislation we create, the more complicated it becomes in terms of dealing with ballots
16:20.480 --> 16:24.200
that are mailed in in different ways and all those kinds of things.
16:24.200 --> 16:29.480
But nonetheless, I appreciate your willingness to allow us to delay the hearing until today
16:29.480 --> 16:34.040
and appreciate those of you who come, as well as appreciate the history that you've given
16:34.040 --> 16:35.840
us about the project itself.
16:35.840 --> 16:40.680
I won't waste time telling us what CARS, Cal Access and CARS is.
16:40.680 --> 16:44.480
Their terms are often interchangeable, but clearly Cal Access is the current system we
16:44.480 --> 16:49.320
have and CARS is the future system that we're trying to build at this time.
16:49.320 --> 16:52.520
So we have a clarity, at least with regards to that.
16:52.520 --> 16:57.000
And I know oftentimes myself and others, we use the term interchangeably when we shouldn't,
16:57.000 --> 17:00.160
but hopefully people will understand that.
17:00.160 --> 17:05.880
As most of you know, I became Secretary of State in 2021, January of 2021, a surprise
17:05.880 --> 17:09.640
present from the governor.
17:09.640 --> 17:17.640
And I appreciate his confidence and nomination of me, a nomination that I had not anticipated
17:17.640 --> 17:19.200
at all in my career.
17:19.200 --> 17:23.520
But I appreciate it because I had worked, not only with budget issues, but also worked
17:23.520 --> 17:28.360
as you pointed out as the chair of elections and then continued to serve on the elections
17:28.360 --> 17:33.120
committee even after I became the chair of the budget, mainly because I wanted to make
17:33.120 --> 17:36.520
sure there was some continuity with regards to the election committee and that it was
17:36.520 --> 17:43.200
not taken as just something to be done as a responsibility rather than something as
17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
a passion.
17:44.200 --> 17:50.000
I want to thank your staff, Scott, who was adamant about helping me with the election
17:50.000 --> 17:54.120
committee when he was on my staff and the work that he did, he truly was a champion
17:54.120 --> 17:58.280
of elections and has continued to be that in the process.
17:58.280 --> 18:04.600
When I became Secretary of State in 2021, I came in with the understanding and with
18:04.600 --> 18:10.640
the information that I had received just on the surface that CARS would go live in 2021.
18:10.640 --> 18:15.640
And at the end of June 2021, there would be a celebration for CARS, and that was something
18:15.640 --> 18:17.240
that I would look forward to.
18:17.240 --> 18:22.080
It was like, whew, I don't have to deal with CARS, it's done, it's over, and it's going
18:22.080 --> 18:24.440
to be successful.
18:24.440 --> 18:29.720
Shortly thereafter, and as I pointed out to all of the leadership and members of what
18:29.720 --> 18:33.880
I met with them as I became Secretary of State, and I'm not sure if it was a good thing to
18:33.880 --> 18:38.680
say or not, but I said to them, there's nothing I hate more than someone who says to me, after
18:38.680 --> 18:44.800
the fact, I started to tell you, but, and then they didn't, and as a result of that,
18:44.800 --> 18:48.640
they didn't tell me, and because they thought I didn't want to hear it or that they just
18:48.640 --> 18:50.960
didn't want to reveal things at that point.
18:50.960 --> 18:56.360
And so that was a statement I made to my staff and the new staff and as well as the current
18:56.360 --> 19:02.880
staff in SOS, and immediately people started to tell me the things that I hoped I wouldn't
19:02.880 --> 19:03.880
hear.
19:03.880 --> 19:09.160
And those were the things with regards to the issues of data migration, the high number
19:09.160 --> 19:14.160
of testing defects, the negative feedback from the user community, and those kinds of
19:14.160 --> 19:15.480
things.
19:15.480 --> 19:20.640
When we looked at the data and I met with all of those that were involved with the project,
19:20.640 --> 19:25.400
it was clear that there was not a person who was in defense of the system.
19:25.400 --> 19:30.440
Even those who initially said, yes, it's ready to go, by the time we began to ask questions
19:30.440 --> 19:35.240
and continue to probe into it, whether they were directly involved or indirectly involved
19:35.240 --> 19:39.520
with the system, all of them resolved at the point that June 30th, that was unrealistic,
19:39.520 --> 19:42.120
that they were not ready, it was not ready to go live.
19:42.120 --> 19:47.040
There was no user testing above 40% with regards in terms of acceptance.
19:47.040 --> 19:51.640
And so as a result, and it was not going to get there because there was no effort to test
19:51.640 --> 19:53.520
again and again and again.
19:53.520 --> 19:58.320
So it became clear to me that there was no confidence in the readiness to launch the
19:58.320 --> 19:59.320
system.
19:59.320 --> 20:03.200
We could have done the politically correct thing and launched the system and blamed everybody
20:03.200 --> 20:06.360
else for its failures.
20:06.360 --> 20:09.320
But I thought California deserved better.
20:09.320 --> 20:15.120
And as a result, we proceeded to try to figure out what was wrong and what we could do.
20:15.120 --> 20:18.840
As I said, we asked everyone who was involved with the system who was technically working
20:18.840 --> 20:23.000
on the system, whether we consulted the California Department of Technology that was not really
20:23.000 --> 20:26.760
involved with the system, that I thought they were and could have been and should have been,
20:26.760 --> 20:31.080
but they weren't based on the structure of the kinds of things that were taking place.
20:31.080 --> 20:34.600
So we had to then ask the question, how do we, where do we go from here?
20:34.600 --> 20:37.480
Because I asked the question, how soon will it be ready?
20:37.480 --> 20:38.640
No one knew.
20:38.640 --> 20:39.920
Where are we in the process?
20:39.920 --> 20:43.520
No one could say we're at stage three and we need to get to stage four or whatever the
20:43.520 --> 20:45.560
terminology they wanted to use.
20:45.560 --> 20:48.400
No one could ensure me that this thing would work.
20:48.400 --> 20:52.120
And that was concerning to me as we tried to move forward.
20:52.120 --> 20:56.520
My response was with the input from California Department of Technology, CDT.
20:56.520 --> 21:01.800
I made what proved to be a prudent decision to have an independent assessment of the system,
21:01.800 --> 21:06.440
the system's readiness to determine the future course of action to ensure the successful
21:06.440 --> 21:08.640
completion of the CARS project.
21:08.640 --> 21:13.880
So rather than continuing down a road that no one knew where we were going, I decided
21:13.880 --> 21:16.160
at that point we need to figure out where we were.
21:16.160 --> 21:20.920
Where are we in this process and how do we get back to resolving the issue and how do
21:20.920 --> 21:23.840
we get CARS moving again?
21:23.840 --> 21:28.240
I paused the ongoing development work except for some data preparation activities that
21:28.240 --> 21:32.800
would be useful for both the current and or future project activities.
21:32.800 --> 21:37.560
We partnered with the California Department of Technology to create the solicitation tool,
21:37.560 --> 21:41.640
document for the independent assessment, review and evaluate the responses, and oversee the
21:41.640 --> 21:44.720
six-month independent assessment review process.
21:44.720 --> 21:49.160
And I should mention all of this, that once we had had this conversation, made some determinations
21:49.160 --> 21:54.760
and looked around, we also made sure that the governor, the leaders in both houses were
21:54.760 --> 21:59.560
aware of the challenges we faced and the fact that we were postponing the launch and that
21:59.560 --> 22:03.680
we wanted to do an independent assessment to see where we were.
22:03.680 --> 22:08.720
At the same time as the independent assessment, internally within SOS, we conducted an inventory
22:08.720 --> 22:14.520
of the existing CARS project team organization structure and a robust lesson learned survey
22:14.520 --> 22:18.080
led by the organizational change management consultant.
22:18.080 --> 22:22.600
We recognized, at least in the initial phases, I was questioning and asking that there were
22:22.600 --> 22:28.360
clearly some structural internal issues with how we were operating the project or how we
22:28.360 --> 22:31.080
were trying to get the project off.
22:31.080 --> 22:34.520
And those management issues needed to be addressed if we were actually to move forward.
22:34.520 --> 22:38.920
We couldn't just continue to move forward as if there had been no issues internally
22:38.920 --> 22:45.960
within SOS in terms of our IT department, management department, those who were involved
22:45.960 --> 22:50.840
in a tremendous amount of challenges in terms of personnel itself and that we needed to
22:50.840 --> 22:55.680
have a whole new way of thinking with regards to this project and the management of it.
22:55.680 --> 22:59.600
The independent assessment report concluded that CARS was not ready for public use and
22:59.600 --> 23:05.680
stated that a solution to replace CARS access is possible.
23:05.680 --> 23:09.960
The report identified, and I'm sure most of you have seen the early on report, the report
23:09.960 --> 23:15.080
identified the reusable work products of the current project such as data cleansing, readiness
23:15.080 --> 23:20.600
planning documents and processes, project management plan documents and processes, and
23:20.600 --> 23:24.600
some prior market research questionnaires and findings.
23:24.600 --> 23:28.800
And they recommended needed actions to develop a successful system.
23:28.800 --> 23:32.440
Based on this information and input from the project leadership team, the CARS project
23:32.440 --> 23:38.480
restarted in July with what I believe is a more robust path to completing the CARS project
23:38.480 --> 23:39.920
successfully.
23:39.920 --> 23:46.320
As the CARS project was being restarted, our SOS ITD department, our Information Technology
23:46.320 --> 23:51.640
Division was tasked with developing a strategy to maintain the health and reliability of
23:51.640 --> 23:54.280
the existing CARS access system.
23:54.280 --> 23:59.360
We realized that this was an old system that didn't have, that had basically much of the
23:59.360 --> 24:03.720
things that we normally use in the system were no longer available, and I charged them
24:03.720 --> 24:06.840
with the fact that you're going to have to figure out a system that's going to keep this
24:06.840 --> 24:12.000
thing alive while we're basically building a new system.
24:12.000 --> 24:19.480
Our Information Technology Division supports, as we're restarting it, as I said, they were
24:19.480 --> 24:23.520
tasked with the development strategies to maintain the health and reliability of the
24:23.520 --> 24:24.520
system.
24:24.520 --> 24:30.560
Our Information Technology Division supports, monitors and maintains the many software programs
24:30.560 --> 24:35.840
of the CARS access system to make the services more maintainable without negatively impacting
24:35.840 --> 24:37.440
current usage.
24:37.440 --> 24:43.760
These services are built on a platform that is no longer supported by any vendors.
24:43.760 --> 24:48.280
Because CARS access was designed and implemented based on the hardware and programming language
24:48.280 --> 24:53.600
limitations of the time it was created, the system cannot be upgraded to meet the modern
24:53.600 --> 24:59.120
demands of the current campaign finance and lobbying activities reporting environment.
24:59.120 --> 25:04.760
As a result, the legacy systems such as CARS access become slower and slower over time,
25:04.760 --> 25:09.400
which means performance, efficiency, and productivity can also be decreased.
25:09.400 --> 25:15.360
ITD has made several significant changes in operations to enhance the stability, recovery,
25:15.360 --> 25:18.080
and support of the CARS access system.
25:18.080 --> 25:24.400
Most importantly, ITD has created a CARS access recovery task force group that monitors system
25:24.400 --> 25:29.000
issues and outages 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
25:29.000 --> 25:34.880
ITD incorporated monitoring and reporting capability alerts when CARS access core components
25:34.880 --> 25:41.000
can become unreachable, unavailable, or triggered by a defined threshold.
25:41.000 --> 25:47.720
ITD has also taken steps to protect the existing platform against catastrophic failure, including
25:47.720 --> 25:54.840
one they developed a disaster recovery strategy, they established cloud archive backups, backup
25:54.840 --> 25:59.760
retention schedules, and procedures that are critical to the recovery of CARS access critical
25:59.760 --> 26:05.080
business applications and data, and they developed a detailed recovery procedure, including manual
26:05.080 --> 26:10.560
processes that support the recovery strategy and provide for the recovery of critical business
26:10.560 --> 26:11.560
applications.
26:11.560 --> 26:16.480
Over the last several months, most outages impacting CARS access have been attributed
26:16.480 --> 26:21.200
to incidents involving significant damage outside of SOS control.
26:21.200 --> 26:26.200
ITD is working with an internet service provider to provide redundancy, which would reduce
26:26.200 --> 26:30.480
dependency on a single connection, resulting in fewer outages.
26:30.480 --> 26:36.080
ITD plans on making CARS access more reliable by upgrading components.
26:36.080 --> 26:40.960
In the event of a catastrophic incident, the CARS access systems are backed up nightly
26:40.960 --> 26:43.520
and restored in several locations.
26:43.520 --> 26:50.720
Finally, ITD, our information technology division continues to investigate new ways to maintain
26:50.720 --> 26:56.800
the existing CARS access system and its performance, such as exploring places CARS access on new
26:56.800 --> 26:58.200
hardware.
26:58.200 --> 27:02.840
I want to thank our California Department of Technology for important role it has played
27:02.840 --> 27:06.680
to set the CARS project in the right course.
27:06.680 --> 27:10.080
In closing some of the comments, I want to thank those for having me to provide this
27:10.080 --> 27:11.080
presentation.
27:11.080 --> 27:16.480
Our team here today with SOS, our SOST is in Margie Hyder, who is the acting chief of
27:16.480 --> 27:22.640
our political reform division, Tristan Comier, who is the chief information technology division,
27:22.640 --> 27:27.640
Tamara Johnson, who is the chief budget officer, John Heimlund, who is the assistant project
27:27.640 --> 27:32.400
director, and Michael Carter, our special project advisor.
27:32.400 --> 27:36.840
Some of you have asked, in addition to that, some of the other questions that have been
27:36.840 --> 27:42.240
posed to us on a regular basis is, you know, what confidence do we have that this will
27:42.240 --> 27:43.640
work this time?
27:43.640 --> 27:46.920
And I think that's always the question that's there.
27:46.920 --> 27:51.480
Let me say this, we have learned much from our past experiences, which guides much of
27:51.480 --> 27:53.760
the actions we are discussing today.
27:53.760 --> 27:59.840
You know, when I say that I asked everyone in SOS about the project itself and what's
27:59.840 --> 28:04.680
going on and what's your assessment of it, I discovered that most of the folks in SOS
28:04.680 --> 28:10.280
had no contact or commitment to the project itself, that it had relied heavily upon outside
28:10.280 --> 28:16.400
individuals to run the project, and that our own people inside, not only in our ITD department
28:16.400 --> 28:20.840
but California Department of Technology, had no real engagement and involvement with the
28:20.840 --> 28:22.240
project itself.
28:22.240 --> 28:28.360
So therefore, it made it difficult to determine who was running the project and where we were.
28:28.360 --> 28:31.920
We have learned much from the past experience, which guides, as I said, our actions that
28:31.920 --> 28:33.360
we discussed today.
28:33.360 --> 28:37.320
The project is leveraging the Department of Technology's project approval cycle, the
28:37.320 --> 28:42.320
PAL planning process, which is a formal and deliberate process based on project management
28:42.320 --> 28:44.920
industry standards and best practices.
28:44.920 --> 28:48.720
It is defined in the State System Information Management Manual.
28:48.720 --> 28:54.080
The SOS and the CDT have executed a memorandum of understanding that requires the CDT project
28:54.080 --> 28:57.360
planning and oversight services on the project.
28:57.360 --> 29:01.800
The project's business and technology subject matter expertise is strong, including several
29:01.800 --> 29:07.360
staff who have worked at the SOS and the business and technology side for several years.
29:07.360 --> 29:11.960
The project has proactively increased the number of staff in the organization who hold
29:11.960 --> 29:16.920
project management certification and have robust project management experience.
29:16.920 --> 29:21.840
The project has appropriately staffed the project in terms of skills and expertise to
29:21.840 --> 29:25.960
ensure that all activities will be completed in a timely manner.
29:25.960 --> 29:31.160
For this reason, I have high confidence that the project will successfully complete itself.
29:31.160 --> 29:34.800
Because we have a team that's working inside, as well as with others, that will be brought
29:34.800 --> 29:39.160
in to basically ensure that the project is our project, that it is working and we have
29:39.160 --> 29:40.920
the expertise that's there.
29:40.920 --> 29:44.480
We've hired the necessary individuals, we've increased the staff of those who can manage
29:44.480 --> 29:50.760
the project, who can actually work on the project itself, but also who are a part of
29:50.760 --> 29:56.320
the CARS recovery team, the Cal Access recovery team that's there that's working 24-7 to
29:56.320 --> 30:02.360
make sure that this project, that our CARS project, the Access, will basically be able
30:02.360 --> 30:05.360
to survive during this project itself.
30:05.360 --> 30:09.920
As I pointed out, they have regularly decided different places to place the data, to put
30:09.920 --> 30:14.440
the information nightly, so that if anything were to happen, that they could recover it
30:14.440 --> 30:17.480
and that they could do the work themselves.
30:17.480 --> 30:20.480
Some have asked, you've asked about finances.
30:20.480 --> 30:23.600
We've given you the data on the amount of money, you've seen the money that's been
30:23.600 --> 30:24.600
spent.
30:24.600 --> 30:33.360
Over the last two years, we have, our data shows us that we have, during the pause period,
30:33.360 --> 30:39.840
we had $10 million and this was at the beginning of the project before it was paused in June
30:39.840 --> 30:40.840
and July.
30:40.840 --> 30:47.600
$7 million was spent and that was mainly for dealing with the issues of data migration
30:47.600 --> 30:50.880
and other things that were already in process.
30:50.880 --> 30:56.800
This past 22-23 budget has been $11,289, that's actually been it.
30:56.800 --> 31:04.880
The budget, the actual expenditure has only been $208,792 because we have, were basically
31:04.880 --> 31:10.160
pause the project, working on the documents that we have to put together and basically
31:10.160 --> 31:12.960
going out and doing solicitation.
31:12.960 --> 31:19.760
So we have not continued to just expend money on the project without having direct information
31:19.760 --> 31:23.360
as to who would be doing the project and those kinds of things.
31:23.360 --> 31:26.520
You've also asked about the outages and I think we've, I've answered those.
31:26.520 --> 31:30.920
I'm not sure if there's more that's needed but we have worked to make sure that those
31:30.920 --> 31:36.760
outages do not, the ones that, that folks have mostly been concerned about were ones
31:36.760 --> 31:37.760
beyond our control.
31:37.760 --> 31:43.200
It was not necessarily, it was had to do with CDT and many of their issues and so the project
31:43.200 --> 31:47.840
was delayed or shut down during that timeframe but they were not due to SOS.
31:47.840 --> 31:54.600
As I said, we have a 24-7 project that's going on with our office, with our ITD department
31:54.600 --> 32:00.760
and chairs here that basically addresses the issues quickly and, and, and deals with it
32:00.760 --> 32:01.920
very quickly.
32:01.920 --> 32:06.920
To avoid any catastrophe, as I pointed out, we have nightly removed the data to different
32:06.920 --> 32:07.920
places.
32:07.920 --> 32:12.000
We have been working with various vendors in terms of internet, storage, those kinds of
32:12.000 --> 32:15.800
things so that we're not just ignoring the fact that this is not broken down, that it
32:15.800 --> 32:20.160
might, if it did, we could recover it and so our staff, our team, we have a team of
32:20.160 --> 32:27.400
those who basically deal with the, the Cal Access 24-7 to make sure that it is functional
32:27.400 --> 32:32.240
and we're looking for various other forms of, of storage and placement for a platform
32:32.240 --> 32:34.520
for, for that data that's there.
32:34.520 --> 32:38.120
So we're aware of the fact that the system is old and as a result have given a tremendous
32:38.120 --> 32:41.400
attention to make sure that it can survive during this process.
32:41.400 --> 32:47.800
We are committed to making sure that Cal Access will, will survive until we have cars in place.
32:47.800 --> 32:53.160
We have, like I said, we've recruited experienced staff to avoid over-reliance on contracted
32:53.160 --> 32:54.660
staff.
32:54.660 --> 32:58.560
We need to, we, we believe we need to lead and direct the project rather than relying
32:58.560 --> 33:03.640
upon contract project managers that are outside of Cal SOS.
33:03.640 --> 33:06.180
The project schedule should be realistic.
33:06.180 --> 33:10.240
We have not identified, as some of you've asked, how much money will we need?
33:10.240 --> 33:14.200
We have not identified that because we haven't hired the person who's going to do the work.
33:14.200 --> 33:17.640
We don't want to give unrealistic expectations that it's going to cost a certain amount and
33:17.640 --> 33:22.800
it'll discover that that's not going to happen because, because it demands other kinds of
33:22.800 --> 33:23.800
things.
33:23.800 --> 33:31.240
Cal, you know, the Cal Access and cars is, is a extremely complicated, as you know, project
33:31.240 --> 33:36.680
that has a lot of demands and a lot of expectations on what we want to happen when a person goes
33:36.680 --> 33:40.400
into that and pushes those buttons and those things that happen.
33:40.400 --> 33:44.440
It sounds easy, but it's really complicated and as a result, we want to make sure that
33:44.440 --> 33:45.600
it does that.
33:45.600 --> 33:48.720
We've been working with, and I'm grateful for all of those who are listed here who
33:48.720 --> 33:49.920
will be testifying today.
33:49.920 --> 33:51.560
We have met with all of those individuals.
33:51.560 --> 33:52.720
We've worked with them.
33:52.720 --> 33:56.680
In addition to that, why I believe we have so many folks now that are working with us
33:56.680 --> 33:59.400
because they want cars to be successful.
33:59.400 --> 34:05.240
My staff meets monthly with all of the partners, external partners and internal partners.
34:05.240 --> 34:09.840
We met with different groups concerning things they'd like to have added to cars.
34:09.840 --> 34:14.560
We've said to them very clearly, we're listing and we want to make that happen, but we will
34:14.560 --> 34:19.200
not delay the project because of a new fangle dangle that might be out there that somebody
34:19.200 --> 34:20.640
can add to it.
34:20.640 --> 34:25.280
We know that like anything else, a dissertation or wherever, there's never completion, there's
34:25.280 --> 34:29.560
never an end, but you have to draw an end to it and we want to make sure cars meets
34:29.560 --> 34:33.200
all of the needs that have been identified in the legislature and if we can add additional
34:33.200 --> 34:41.480
things as we've met with the individuals who are working with elections that small things
34:41.480 --> 34:45.080
like signatures and what have you that people think we should not have to have now and being
34:45.080 --> 34:48.560
able to file things without everybody having to come in and sign.
34:48.560 --> 34:52.560
All those kinds of things that really complicate people's lives are things that we may be able
34:52.560 --> 34:55.600
to accomplish and so we're listening to individuals.
34:55.600 --> 34:59.480
We have everyone that's on board that's meeting, our staff is meeting with all of our partners
34:59.480 --> 35:05.480
every month, like I said, a monthly and we're making the information available.
35:05.480 --> 35:09.040
We hope that the project that they will have some input and I think all of them are having
35:09.040 --> 35:12.680
input in the project that's there.
35:12.680 --> 35:17.680
So we've learned a lot from the past process that was there in terms of who needs to be
35:17.680 --> 35:22.240
engaged, how people should be engaged, what our goals should be, what we should be focused
35:22.240 --> 35:27.560
on and not driven necessarily by time and limitations and saying that people say well
35:27.560 --> 35:32.240
it has to be ready in a year but that was one of the problems of the other project.
35:32.240 --> 35:37.560
There were constant folks giving deadlines and things that were unrealistic and demanding
35:37.560 --> 35:42.840
the use of software that didn't meet the needs and so in this process of looking at where
35:42.840 --> 35:46.520
we were and reviewing we realized that we had to have a different process, different
35:46.520 --> 35:52.280
working operations and that we're thankful to the CDT and for those that are working
35:52.280 --> 35:58.520
on the project and all of the community members who have allowed us the opportunity to begin
35:58.520 --> 36:02.680
the project again and to get it done for California.
36:02.680 --> 36:04.960
Thank you Dr. Weber.
36:04.960 --> 36:09.440
First let me just applaud you and your department for running these elections that we're just
36:09.440 --> 36:14.200
completing in a terrific, fair, honest, transparent way.
36:14.200 --> 36:18.280
You should never take those things for granted and I should have said that at the beginning.
36:18.280 --> 36:23.560
I apologize for that but we're so grateful for you and your department and all the election
36:23.560 --> 36:29.920
officials in California who have done such a good, exceptional job in our elections that
36:29.920 --> 36:31.920
we're just finishing.
36:31.920 --> 36:39.320
Let me also say that I appreciate your caution and sensitivity in making projections going
36:39.320 --> 36:41.200
forward.
36:41.200 --> 36:48.240
As we recount the history it steals us to not repeating in a lot of different ways and
36:48.240 --> 36:53.680
certainly not trying to be as realistic and straightforward about cost and completion
36:53.680 --> 36:55.680
as one of those elements.
36:55.680 --> 37:01.160
I do want to ask a couple of follow-up questions if I may on the issue of outages.
37:01.160 --> 37:06.920
I appreciate the outages that have been caused by outside forces and you mentioned those
37:06.920 --> 37:14.480
but I'm interested in knowing how many outages have there been that are internally focused
37:14.480 --> 37:18.880
in the system and you may not have experts here who can answer that if you're not able
37:18.880 --> 37:25.400
to but I'd like to know over the last 10 years how many have there been?
37:25.400 --> 37:26.400
10 years.
37:26.400 --> 37:27.400
Every year.
37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
I do have.
37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
You get the alerts.
37:29.400 --> 37:36.720
You said you've created systems that allow you to find out when there's a problem.
37:36.720 --> 37:37.720
We get the alerts.
37:37.720 --> 37:43.880
I'm not sure if people if there are actual outages versus access to data and information
37:43.880 --> 37:47.320
may not be readily available because the system is sometimes slow.
37:47.320 --> 37:52.320
I do have my ITD person here and Christian is here.
37:52.320 --> 37:59.800
I think there's some microphone somewhere behind me that can probably answer that question.
37:59.800 --> 38:04.720
It sounds daunting when you think about the numbers but if you actually look at it in
38:04.720 --> 38:11.000
terms of what those numbers mean and he's much more tech savvy than I would ever be
38:11.000 --> 38:13.880
so I'll allow Christian if you can answer some of that for us.
38:13.880 --> 38:16.720
I don't know if I can go back 10 years but I can give you.
38:16.720 --> 38:19.880
He was only 12 years old at the time so that's probably why.
38:19.880 --> 38:22.160
Did you give us your name for the record?
38:22.160 --> 38:23.160
Tristan Cormier.
38:23.160 --> 38:24.160
Tristan.
38:24.160 --> 38:25.160
Okay.
38:25.160 --> 38:26.160
Thank you for being here.
38:26.160 --> 38:27.160
Okay.
38:27.160 --> 38:28.160
So the question was how many outages?
38:28.160 --> 38:29.160
In 21.
38:29.160 --> 38:30.160
I'll simplify it.
38:30.160 --> 38:34.520
In 21 or in 22 thus far how many I mean I've certainly gone on the system and not
38:34.520 --> 38:36.560
been able to get information.
38:36.560 --> 38:37.560
Yeah.
38:37.560 --> 38:38.560
So there's four.
38:38.560 --> 38:39.560
How many have there been?
38:39.560 --> 38:43.960
So since 2022 there's been about four outages that are significant and we see outages.
38:43.960 --> 38:50.160
There's something that we can't recover from that would take over 24 hours so about four.
38:50.160 --> 38:52.640
Internally we haven't had too many outages.
38:52.640 --> 38:56.800
On average we have probably about four to five outages that could be something as simple
38:56.800 --> 39:00.840
as rebooting the web server and that lasts less than five to seven minutes.
39:00.840 --> 39:04.000
So how many of those have there been again?
39:04.000 --> 39:10.080
Where the system isn't working and unresponsive whether that's for a minute or an hour.
39:10.080 --> 39:14.720
How many of those have internally now I'm only talking about within the system itself.
39:14.720 --> 39:16.840
How many have there been this year so far?
39:16.840 --> 39:17.840
Yeah.
39:17.840 --> 39:21.880
Again I think there's two different questions so when it's not responsive again though those
39:21.880 --> 39:24.200
are about four of those.
39:24.200 --> 39:25.200
Internally?
39:25.200 --> 39:30.000
They're both internal and external so if the system goes down for CDT or if the other
39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
fiber goes down then we don't have it internally.
39:32.000 --> 39:37.120
So if you're asking for about interruptions that could be slightly different.
39:37.120 --> 39:41.240
So what we do is for example I'm talking about anything.
39:41.240 --> 39:45.000
So an interruption would apply and something greater than that.
39:45.000 --> 39:51.040
So I'm trying to get a sense of how broken is the system I mean so if it's running great
39:51.040 --> 39:54.320
then tell me it's running great and we can all go back.
39:54.320 --> 39:58.080
It's definitely a Frankenstein like we'll say before here's some statistics we can have
39:58.080 --> 39:59.520
for the last several months.
39:59.520 --> 40:04.640
For example in July we received about 176 alerts.
40:04.640 --> 40:06.920
Alert for us is up and down.
40:06.920 --> 40:11.120
On average it recovers in 2.8 minutes.
40:11.120 --> 40:15.280
In August we had around 214 alerts.
40:15.280 --> 40:18.240
Average time was 2.6 minutes.
40:18.240 --> 40:21.840
In September we had 165 alerts.
40:21.840 --> 40:24.600
Average recovery time 2.3 minutes.
40:24.600 --> 40:32.680
In August we had 214 and in July we had 176 around 2.6 minutes.
40:32.680 --> 40:38.240
So I appreciate that by month so look at what I can do with the math and it's an average
40:38.240 --> 40:42.000
of 190 a month but in 21 how many alerts have there been?
40:42.000 --> 40:43.760
Do you have a total number for 21?
40:43.760 --> 40:46.800
I don't have that number off the top of my head would it be in 2021?
40:46.800 --> 40:52.560
I think we implemented the alerting system in 2022 and so what we're talking about right
40:52.560 --> 40:55.880
now is the CARTS team which is the Cadillac's rescue team.
40:55.880 --> 40:58.640
All that was kind of created in 2022.
40:58.640 --> 41:06.320
So do you have any way of giving me the facts on the alerts, outages, problems going back
41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
in each year?
41:07.320 --> 41:08.320
Do you have any way to give me?
41:08.320 --> 41:11.680
Well I've only been here for not that long but I can tell you what have you know I can
41:11.680 --> 41:14.320
give you some information about 2022 when we started doing the alerting.
41:14.320 --> 41:19.480
So what we see is we monitor up-down statuses for Cadillac's and those can be something
41:19.480 --> 41:25.360
as simple as a two-minute outage and then recover and then sometimes we have to kind
41:25.360 --> 41:28.800
of intervene and maybe we start a service.
41:28.800 --> 41:31.640
So I don't know what the number is off the top of my head.
41:31.640 --> 41:34.200
I do have a couple of guys here who work on it.
41:34.200 --> 41:36.200
I just don't have the number for 2021.
41:36.200 --> 41:39.800
Okay, if you can get some of those facts for us if I appreciate it.
41:39.800 --> 41:47.120
Secretary, I'm trying to understand a little bit better the decision to postpone and you
41:47.120 --> 41:50.080
mentioned the stakeholders I know we're going to hear from them.
41:50.080 --> 41:54.760
Were you able to consult with them on this decision to postpone in 2021?
41:54.760 --> 42:01.880
You mentioned the three issues, data migration, testing, defects, feedback from the user community.
42:01.880 --> 42:06.960
I know the FBPC and the legislation are partners with you and that's where they consulted and
42:06.960 --> 42:08.840
the decision to delay.
42:08.840 --> 42:13.160
All of them were involved with the staff and myself in terms of what was going on with
42:13.160 --> 42:18.680
the project and whether or not there was anyone who could actually say this project was working.
42:18.680 --> 42:24.560
In the end, they all agreed that the project needed to be delayed because it was not going
42:24.560 --> 42:27.000
to do what was anticipated.
42:27.000 --> 42:30.480
We got, like I said, the user testing and those kinds of things were clear.
42:30.480 --> 42:32.800
So all those groups agreed the FBPC and others?
42:32.800 --> 42:34.840
I'm not sure if they agreed.
42:34.840 --> 42:35.840
They'd have to.
42:35.840 --> 42:40.600
I think afterwards there was a meeting that all agreed at that point that could not go
42:40.600 --> 42:41.600
forward.
42:41.600 --> 42:45.840
That they were pleased that we had halted the project because of the data that we were
42:45.840 --> 42:48.120
receiving that they had received before I had.
42:48.120 --> 42:51.280
I mean, they were all aware of the user data that was there.
42:51.280 --> 42:56.240
I was probably the last one to be informed that this project had a significant number
42:56.240 --> 42:58.240
of problems.
42:58.240 --> 43:05.880
And when I went back and looked at the, some of the budget language for the funding, this
43:05.880 --> 43:09.960
is before you were, maybe you were chair of the Budget Committee at the time, but not
43:09.960 --> 43:15.880
this, certainly not the Secretary of State, but the initial funding was to provide for
43:15.880 --> 43:25.160
a going out to bid on vendors to help create, implement this reboot.
43:25.160 --> 43:28.240
Who were the firms that were hired to do the work?
43:28.240 --> 43:29.520
I don't remember the names.
43:29.520 --> 43:34.320
I hadn't been asked that question, but I'm sure some of the, Margie might know.
43:34.320 --> 43:35.320
She knows.
43:35.320 --> 43:37.520
This is our, Margie was there doing the project.
43:37.520 --> 43:41.320
And now she is the interim director of the project.
43:41.320 --> 43:42.320
Yes.
43:42.320 --> 43:43.320
Great.
43:43.320 --> 43:44.320
Hi, Margie.
43:44.320 --> 43:45.320
Can you identify yourself?
43:45.320 --> 43:46.320
Yes.
43:46.320 --> 43:47.320
My name is Margie Heider.
43:47.320 --> 43:51.680
And I am the acting division chief for the political reform division.
43:51.680 --> 43:59.120
So your question is who was- In 2016 and 2017, the Budget Act provided a million dollars
43:59.120 --> 44:08.800
to go for a out to bid for that management technology help to implement this improvement.
44:08.800 --> 44:10.040
Who was retained?
44:10.040 --> 44:13.280
What firms were retained to do the work?
44:13.280 --> 44:23.400
The system integrator that first developed the system, that company name was Prospecta.
44:23.400 --> 44:25.320
Prospecta was the one that was retained?
44:25.320 --> 44:26.320
Correct.
44:26.320 --> 44:28.440
Prospecta or Prospecta?
44:28.440 --> 44:29.440
Prospecta.
44:29.440 --> 44:36.840
And what was the requirements of that contract?
44:36.840 --> 44:44.120
I was not involved in the project at that time, but what I can tell you is the requirements
44:44.120 --> 44:48.520
of the project, do you mean what was the system supposed to do?
44:48.520 --> 44:53.000
What were they required to do for the many hundreds of thousands, if not millions of
44:53.000 --> 44:57.920
dollars that they were paid?
44:57.920 --> 45:03.960
I did not see the contract, so I can't tell you-
45:03.960 --> 45:04.960
Okay.
45:04.960 --> 45:05.960
Exactly.
45:05.960 --> 45:07.920
Is that the only firm that was retained to do that work?
45:07.920 --> 45:08.920
Correct.
45:08.920 --> 45:13.920
So what I see in the budget documents that the secretary provided in 2018 and 2019 shows
45:13.920 --> 45:18.920
an expenditure of $6.1 million for professional services.
45:18.920 --> 45:24.920
Does that all go to the company called Prospecta?
45:24.920 --> 45:25.920
I'm not sure.
45:25.920 --> 45:27.440
Our financial person.
45:27.440 --> 45:33.520
We have a new financial person here, and I'm not sure if she's familiar with that.
45:33.520 --> 45:35.800
Exactly who the amount went to.
45:35.800 --> 45:38.920
It probably was, at least the vast majority of it, yeah.
45:38.920 --> 45:39.920
Okay.
45:39.920 --> 45:45.240
And as a part of that contract, they had deliverables that they were required to provide.
45:45.240 --> 45:49.600
That part of the agreement that was forged with that company?
45:49.600 --> 45:56.520
I'm not sure if our attorneys here to deal with the contract said-
45:56.520 --> 45:58.160
Let me say that.
45:58.160 --> 46:04.000
Some of my concerns with the project, as I went into it, was the fact that there were
46:04.000 --> 46:07.080
no deliverables identified.
46:07.080 --> 46:11.880
It was time and work, but not necessarily specific deliverables.
46:11.880 --> 46:15.320
And that is a concern that I had, and that is a concern that I've expressed in going
46:15.320 --> 46:21.400
forward that the new contracts have to have deliverables attached to the resources that
46:21.400 --> 46:22.400
they receive.
46:22.400 --> 46:23.400
Yeah.
46:23.400 --> 46:27.440
It was not a part of my understanding, it was not a part of it.
46:27.440 --> 46:28.520
That would make a lot of sense.
46:28.520 --> 46:33.000
So I don't want to assume this, so let me ask the question about whether or not there
46:33.000 --> 46:37.840
was any kind of clawback provisions in those contracts that provided that if they weren't
46:37.840 --> 46:43.480
able to deliver the services that they claimed they were providing in the state that we would
46:43.480 --> 46:45.280
be reimbursed those funds.
46:45.280 --> 46:50.640
I asked that question also, having spent my married life, married to an attorney and
46:50.640 --> 46:55.800
a judge, that I wanted to know how do we get out of it and how do we get my money back.
46:55.800 --> 47:00.360
That was not a part of the contract that I'm familiar with.
47:00.360 --> 47:02.160
And I asked those questions.
47:02.160 --> 47:06.880
That's one of the reasons why we decided to move forward with some of the data, the use
47:06.880 --> 47:11.440
of resources with regards to data migration and what have you.
47:11.440 --> 47:13.840
But those things were not in the contract.
47:13.840 --> 47:18.320
And I was very concerned about the contract itself, with regards to what we were going
47:18.320 --> 47:19.320
to get from it.
47:19.320 --> 47:20.680
I'm familiar with good reason.
47:20.680 --> 47:25.240
I'm not really familiar with this firm and their experience in this area and their lack
47:25.240 --> 47:26.240
of performance.
47:26.240 --> 47:29.520
That's the first time I've heard their name, Prospecta.
47:29.520 --> 47:34.400
Is that a California firm?
47:34.400 --> 47:41.520
Hi, so my name's Dana Furby.
47:41.520 --> 47:48.320
I am one of the council that has been somewhat involved in the project, maybe longer than
47:48.320 --> 47:51.000
a lot of the people here.
47:51.000 --> 47:57.680
At least I knew enough about some of the time when Prospecta was the vendor that was building
47:57.680 --> 48:05.680
the system and then when we actually pivoted and had a new vendor come on for the system.
48:05.680 --> 48:10.480
So I want to make myself available to answer some of the questions that I, at least my
48:10.480 --> 48:13.040
understanding of some of the answers.
48:13.040 --> 48:17.960
I didn't negotiate the contracts or wasn't involved in them, but I did look at the contracts
48:17.960 --> 48:22.560
quite a bit because at the time that it was clear we were going to make some changes throughout
48:22.560 --> 48:34.440
the way I was advising and directing on what remedies were available to us and what, well,
48:34.440 --> 48:36.120
mostly what remedies were available to us.
48:36.120 --> 48:38.760
Great, and it would be great if we could get a copy of the contract.
48:38.760 --> 48:40.840
But let me ask you a follow-up question.
48:40.840 --> 48:47.520
Was it an Evergreen contract that provided services each year or month and this was renewed
48:47.520 --> 48:53.680
and continued to be renewed or were there deliverables that were required as a part of the contract?
48:53.680 --> 48:59.520
So the first contract that was with Prospecta and I'll just also add that the contract is
48:59.520 --> 49:04.600
actually with Prospecta, the company changed their name to Prospecta during the process
49:04.600 --> 49:05.600
of this.
49:05.600 --> 49:06.600
What was the original name?
49:06.600 --> 49:14.400
I believe it was Enterprise Services LLC or Incorporated Enterprise Services or Enterprise
49:14.400 --> 49:18.440
Systems and we can get a copy of that contract.
49:18.440 --> 49:23.080
That contract, my understanding, is that it was a deliverables-based contract.
49:23.080 --> 49:29.800
So there were phases and there were certain deliverables that needed to be finished before
49:29.800 --> 49:35.080
they would invoice us and be paid for those deliverables.
49:35.080 --> 49:37.440
And then you said there was another vendor that's been retained.
49:37.440 --> 49:38.440
Who's that?
49:38.440 --> 49:39.440
Yes.
49:39.440 --> 49:50.240
So we ended the contract with Prospecta when the project was not finishing to our satisfaction.
49:50.240 --> 49:51.640
What year was that?
49:51.640 --> 49:54.040
I believe that that was in 2020.
49:54.040 --> 49:55.040
Okay.
49:55.040 --> 50:00.560
This is before the actual 21 cancellation or postponement.
50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
Yes.
50:01.560 --> 50:06.560
So in 2020, you had a contract that began in 2017?
50:06.560 --> 50:15.560
I'm not sure when it actually began, but I know that we terminated the contract before
50:15.560 --> 50:22.120
the system had been finished and we did come to some terms with Prospecta over what they
50:22.120 --> 50:29.800
would be paid and what they would not be paid and I believe that I have not looked at that
50:29.800 --> 50:38.520
settlement document again recently, but we did not end up in litigation with Prospecta.
50:38.520 --> 50:39.520
Okay.
50:39.520 --> 50:40.520
And I assume it's a public document.
50:40.520 --> 50:41.520
It's a public document.
50:41.520 --> 50:42.520
We'd love to have a copy of that.
50:42.520 --> 50:43.520
Yes.
50:43.520 --> 50:47.920
Did you know in total what we paid that company, Prospecta?
50:47.920 --> 50:58.360
I think that it was around, well, I think in total, it was probably a little over $4
50:58.360 --> 51:01.320
million and I'm sorry, I'm not totally sure.
51:01.320 --> 51:08.000
I know that the settlement agreement was for significantly less than they had were billing
51:08.000 --> 51:12.280
for the time they had spent, but it was about $3.3 million.
51:12.280 --> 51:19.000
So did you, when you canceled the contract in 2020, did you ask for your money back?
51:19.000 --> 51:23.120
I mean, you said there's a settlement, did you pay them more money when you canceled
51:23.120 --> 51:24.680
that contract?
51:24.680 --> 51:37.480
So some of this, I want to be, well, what we did is we refused to pay the invoice and
51:37.480 --> 51:43.640
said that what we were claiming at the time is that we shouldn't owe any of this money.
51:43.640 --> 51:46.320
We don't have a finished product.
51:46.320 --> 51:57.000
What I don't want to get into is things that our attorney client privileged that had to
51:57.000 --> 52:01.400
do with the negotiations about that.
52:01.400 --> 52:04.320
But you indicated that there were deliverables in the contract.
52:04.320 --> 52:05.880
There were deliverables in the contract.
52:05.880 --> 52:10.760
And was there a contemplation to litigating the fact that they were deliverables that
52:10.760 --> 52:12.800
were not completed?
52:12.800 --> 52:18.920
The secretary has identified a lot of the defects that remained at least in 2021.
52:18.920 --> 52:24.200
Was there any consideration to asking for our money back?
52:24.200 --> 52:26.800
There was consideration for asking for our money back.
52:26.800 --> 52:38.080
And there was some consideration to just refusing to pay for the work that was done, for the
52:38.080 --> 52:45.480
hours that were put in on the next phases up until the time we terminated the contract.
52:45.480 --> 52:48.680
And then you indicated there was another vendor contract that was issued after that.
52:48.680 --> 52:49.920
Who was that to?
52:49.920 --> 52:52.600
After that, there was a company called OSAS.
52:52.600 --> 52:55.680
Can you spell that for me?
52:55.680 --> 52:56.680
O-S-A-A-S.
52:56.680 --> 52:57.680
O-S-A-A-S.
52:57.680 --> 52:58.680
Yes.
52:58.680 --> 53:07.080
I believe the S-A-A-S part stands for Software as a Service, I believe it's a local California
53:07.080 --> 53:08.080
company.
53:08.080 --> 53:09.080
Okay.
53:09.080 --> 53:11.280
And so they were retained in 2020?
53:11.280 --> 53:14.600
I believe they were retained in 2020.
53:14.600 --> 53:17.560
And what was the essence of that contract?
53:17.560 --> 53:23.040
That contract was not a deliverables-based contract.
53:23.040 --> 53:25.360
That was a time and materials contract.
53:25.360 --> 53:30.680
I think I believe the understanding there was we were still going to try to meet the
53:30.680 --> 53:34.320
deadline, the statutorily mandated deadline.
53:34.320 --> 53:40.520
And the way we were going that we thought we would be able to do that was by building
53:40.520 --> 53:43.600
in a little more speed and flexibility.
53:43.600 --> 53:50.360
So there was a software development process called Agile that I think they were trying
53:50.360 --> 53:54.200
to follow at the time.
53:54.200 --> 53:55.200
And.
53:55.200 --> 53:56.200
Okay.
53:56.200 --> 54:04.440
Okay. And when you said just to clarify, statually mandated, I'm not aware of that.
54:04.440 --> 54:08.520
The 19 was the deadline in the legislation. So is there something else that occurred that
54:08.520 --> 54:14.280
created a legal obligation on that office? Well, and again, I haven't prepared by looking at all
54:14.280 --> 54:19.240
the statutes again, but I believe that as you stated in the beginning of this hearing that the
54:19.240 --> 54:28.520
the promise was that it would be completed by 2021. I think there was, at one point,
54:31.160 --> 54:37.320
there was some legislation that extended the date that cars was supposed to be finished. And I
54:37.320 --> 54:45.000
believe that the reason for that extension was due to the California primary changing time.
54:45.000 --> 54:51.400
I see. And there was not, there was agreement between everybody that we did not want to be
54:51.400 --> 54:58.840
launching the system. Okay, I appreciate that clarification. So OSAAS was brought in 2020
54:58.840 --> 55:03.800
on a times in materials. And are they still retained by the office? They're not. And what
55:03.800 --> 55:09.960
happened in that regard? We decided to terminate the contract. When did you terminate the contract?
55:09.960 --> 55:16.760
It was in 2021. 2021. And what was the reason for that? Well, we had decided, we decided as an
55:16.760 --> 55:24.200
agency that the system was not ready to launch. And it was, and we terminated all the contracts
55:24.200 --> 55:28.520
that eventually, you know, there was decisions to terminate the contracts that were in place.
55:29.560 --> 55:34.760
Okay. And so there's no currently outside vendor attained by the office to assist in this now?
55:34.760 --> 55:40.520
There is not a system integrator contract in place at this time. Okay. And when the original
55:40.520 --> 55:45.560
contract was awarded to Prospecta in 2017, were there other bidders for that work?
55:47.560 --> 55:52.920
I don't know. I'm assuming there was. You know, but you don't know whether it was a sole source
55:52.920 --> 55:58.040
contract. The only person that stepped up and said we can, we can fix this. No, I don't know that.
55:58.040 --> 56:02.600
And I wasn't actually employed with the agency until. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you very
56:02.600 --> 56:08.440
much for that insight. I appreciate it very much. Secretary, you mentioned at the, in your remarks
56:08.440 --> 56:14.120
that part of the good work that you're doing on accountability is to identify someone who's
56:14.120 --> 56:19.320
actually in charge. And that your frustration upon coming into the office was that no one
56:19.320 --> 56:25.320
really owned the project. No one was running the project. So there really was no project manager in
56:25.320 --> 56:32.760
the office to run this project starting in 2017. Is that? Yeah. I, you know, when I say own it, well,
56:32.760 --> 56:40.040
Marjorie can respond to it. You know, I, you know, when I ask a person, if I ask who's in charge,
56:40.040 --> 56:45.080
who's really responsible for this, I expect somebody say I am. Okay. But there may be
56:45.080 --> 56:49.880
any persons identified with that. Marjorie can respond to that. Yes. And so in the previous
56:49.880 --> 56:57.480
iteration of the project, the, there was not an SOS person who was in charge of the project.
56:57.480 --> 57:06.840
The project was being run by a project director that was a contracted employee. And one of the
57:06.840 --> 57:13.000
things that we have learned is that that is not a good way to run a project. Currently,
57:13.000 --> 57:20.520
what the secretary has done is made sure that there are SOS staff who are running the project.
57:20.520 --> 57:30.520
So I am the project sponsor. So I am running the project with help from a project director who is
57:30.520 --> 57:37.720
also a secretary of state employee with an assistant project director who is in the room today.
57:37.720 --> 57:47.800
And with Tristan Cormier, who's the chief of the information technology director, we are the
57:47.800 --> 57:52.760
leadership team, the main core of the leadership team. Terrific. And who is the project director?
57:52.760 --> 57:57.320
Can you just share us that person's name so they are a real person? Yes, it is a real person.
57:57.880 --> 58:06.840
And her name is Harjeet Basi, H-A-R-J-I-T-V-A-S-I. Right. And who was the project manager from
58:06.840 --> 58:13.320
the vendor that was in charge of the project? What's that person's name? His name is Kevin Star.
58:14.120 --> 58:23.800
Kevin Star, and he is an employee of Prospecta. No, he was OSAS. He was with the OSAS.
58:23.800 --> 58:29.160
The OSAS group. Who was the project manager for Prospecta? I'm sorry. He was not OSAS. He was
58:29.960 --> 58:35.960
independent. There was a different company. I'm sorry. He was not OSAS. He was with an independent
58:35.960 --> 58:40.120
company. Right. And I'm sorry. I just don't know the name of the company. Right. But I had asked
58:40.120 --> 58:46.360
earlier about outside vendors, and you'd mentioned to Prospecta, and then OSAS as the second. Is
58:46.360 --> 58:53.880
there a third outside vendor then that was hired to help with this project? Several. Could you come
58:53.880 --> 58:58.840
up to the record and share? I go back to my original question, which was who were the outside
58:58.840 --> 59:09.720
vendors that were paid by the state to assist with this project? There was more than Prospecta
59:09.720 --> 59:16.440
and OSAS. Prospecta and OSAS were both what we call system integrators. So there were several
59:16.440 --> 59:25.480
other ancillary contracts that I do not have a list of. I can give you all of them from the
59:25.480 --> 59:35.800
different periods. But the Kevin Star was hired to be the, I guess, what is generally the project
59:35.800 --> 59:47.800
manager. I think we called him the system integration manager. Sam? But he was working for
59:48.680 --> 59:55.000
another company that managed projects. So what's the name of his company? I'm sorry. I don't know.
59:55.000 --> 1:00:01.080
I can't remember off the top of my head. We can get you that contract. It goes back to the same
1:00:01.080 --> 1:00:05.000
questions I'd asked originally about Prospecta. Were there performance requirements in that
1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:11.000
contract? Was it time and materials contract for this one and the others? And I understand you
1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:14.840
may not have all the information here today, but I would like to have the committee would like to
1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:21.720
have that information. All the vendor contracts that were implemented for the Cal access upgrade.
1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:26.280
We can get you all the vendor contracts and I can explain in a timeline with those contracts
1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:31.720
when they were hired and why. Okay. But offhand, you don't know of any of the others offhand,
1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:35.400
the names of the other companies that have been retained. I'm sorry. If I tried to remember the
1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:39.880
names, I think I would get them wrong. Okay. No problem. No problem. Thank you for going through
1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:44.760
this with us. Secretary, I want to again thank you for your patience in these questions. But as
1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:48.840
you can tell, you know, we're all concerned that when you have something that has broken down and
1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:54.120
is able to work as you acknowledge, it's trying to figure out why as we look forward and how we're
1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:58.760
going to do it better. But that looking back is a really important part of trying to figure out
1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:04.040
what were those mistakes, who's in charge, you've correctly identified those weaknesses
1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:09.080
in your testimony and we appreciate that. And let me just finish up with another question.
1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:15.960
When you look at this issue of transparency, is that a new issue for California? It's an issue
1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:21.560
across our country because the public's rightfully demands to know who's trying to influence our
1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:27.240
government, who are the lobbyists, who are the donors and the like. Are there states that you
1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:32.680
think have modeled good examples for finance disclosure portals that as you look around the
1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:37.800
country that we should look to as good examples of this? Because we don't want to, you know,
1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:43.720
build that first model, right? I mean, we are the tech capital of the world. And so you have
1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:49.240
an expectation about our ability to do good technology here in our own state. But if you
1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:54.200
looked around the country and would you identify some states that you think are doing it right?
1:01:54.200 --> 1:02:00.760
We've begun to do that more recently. And, you know, it'd be very honest, you know, when coming
1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:05.640
into office one and being confronted with this issue and battling all the challenges that are
1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:12.280
there as well as running probably a record number of special elections in the 2021 and the recall
1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:17.800
election and then going into the general election with all the election deniers and everything
1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:22.840
else. So we've been lazily focused on that. But this is not by no means had taken a backseat
1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:28.920
in my interest. Interestingly enough, I recently had been talking to our Secretary of State in
1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:33.480
Colorado because they do a lot of innovative things and we've modeled ourselves after them
1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:39.800
in many ways with regards to election. So I'll be talking with her concerning it. But to my surprise,
1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:47.240
what was brought to me recently was Arkansas has a very good system like this that is able to handle
1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:51.960
multiple things and runs quite well. I'm shocked because I'm from Arkansas. And I always think
1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:57.320
of that as not necessarily being the most forward place in the world that I've visited. So I've
1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:02.680
actually begun to inquire in Arkansas and hopefully we'll get a chance to now that we have a break to
1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:07.560
basically talk with them and to visit Arkansas to see what their system looks like as well as some
1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:13.560
of the others as we're meeting with the Secretaries of State across the nation to find out what other
1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:18.680
systems are working well, knowing that we're larger than they are and that it may be more
1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:23.560
difficult to handle the amount that we're dealing with. But nonetheless, you don't want to see what
1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:28.120
they've done. Well, terrific. That's hometown pride. Yeah. Well, I'm not sure hometown pride,
1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:32.600
but I didn't leave when the best condition in Arkansas. Well, I left a lot of relatives there
1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:38.760
though, but but definitely was surprised to learn that they're probably have a system that works as
1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:43.160
a small state. But nonetheless, there may be things we can learn from it. But I think, you know,
1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:47.480
given the those that are working on the project now, and I have to say this in real pride of them,
1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:52.360
because most of them have been with the project for a while now. And my goal is to try to keep
1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:57.320
these people working on the project. I think one of the challenges oftentimes at the state level is
1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:02.760
that we have people moving in and out so quickly that as you can see from some of the history of
1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:07.800
what was in the project, a lot of those folks are gone. You know, when the project didn't work,
1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:11.960
whatever it is, they packed up, they've gone as well, whether they're in house or whether
1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:17.000
there were others have moved on, want to try to keep the team together because that provides a
1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:23.000
consistency for what we want to do as well as the accountability as to who's responsible for
1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:27.400
doing this project and getting this project accomplished much more than just a secretary.
1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:32.760
And so I'm excited about the fact that this team has taken on the challenge
1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:38.040
to complete this project and have pride in making sure that it does happen.
1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:43.160
Some of them have been there doing this, the confusion of who's in charge, who's not in charge,
1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:47.400
who's a new director. I mean, I had difficulty figuring out in the short period of time I had
1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:52.120
to make a decision of go or no go on this project because it was a very short time frame that we
1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:56.840
had to make a decision because all the publicity was saying come June 30th this is going to happen.
1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:01.080
And we had probably a month or a month and a half to really realize that there were problems
1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:05.240
that were there. And then, of course, trying to memorize all the names and all the people. And
1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:09.480
as she mentioned, I kind of remember some of the names and the programs. There were so many
1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:15.560
overlapping folks coming in to try to make this thing work that it just got, you know,
1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:19.800
you didn't know who was in charge, the convoluted nature of it, the various contracts and those
1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:24.760
kinds of things. Once we decided to stop the project, then we began to look at the contracts
1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:29.800
that were in place and those kinds of things that were there. We hope to prevent all of that this
1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:34.360
time in term of being much more deliberate in trying to get the project done. I think the
1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:39.000
time frame pushed people to do things that they may would have done but may not have done as a
1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:43.080
result of having limited time. Great. Thank you, Secretary. Senator Newman, do you have any follow-up
1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:48.920
questions? A couple. So, Secretary, again, thank you for your testimony today. I'm sure this is
1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:55.800
not your first choice after Thanksgiving. So, you know, we talked a little bit about
1:05:55.800 --> 1:06:01.000
responsibilities and assignments. Is there an org chart? I mean, I know, you know,
1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:06.440
Chair has asked for some documentation. Is there an org chart that shows who does what,
1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:11.080
particularly as it relates to these kinds of technology projects at the Secretary of State?
1:06:11.080 --> 1:06:16.360
There is a now and we can get you that information. We've been redoing the org
1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:21.080
chart for the whole organization because I really believe people should be responsible.
1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:25.640
I appreciate that. And so, you know, I think it's important to note that this is one of many
1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:32.200
responsibilities that have become very data intensive that this office is responsible for. And
1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:37.400
historically, you know, it's been an evolution, right? There used to be a bunch of cabinets with
1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:41.880
papers and you can come look them up and that transition to a, you know, paperless kind of
1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.840
database system is obviously very challenging, especially given the size and scope of the state
1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:53.400
and your responsibilities. And so, you know, as it relates to this, right, so we've talked about
1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:59.960
sort of future plans, but I am one and I hear constantly from others about challenges accessing
1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:05.960
the system, right? And so, you know, I probably point out that for the average user, they make no
1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:11.880
distinction between a data interruption and an outage and, you know, let's call it a data
1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:17.960
interruption. It is not uncommon to try and look for data. So, I understand kind of what you're
1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:23.720
endeavoring to do long term, but what if anything can be done, you know, within budget, within resources
1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:28.920
as an interim solution to minimize these outages? And I see Mr. Cormier shaking his head, right?
1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:33.960
And the answer seems to be by your facial expression, probably nothing, but if you wouldn't mind.
1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:43.880
I got my lead database engineer behind here and there's a couple of things we want to do. That's
1:07:43.880 --> 1:07:51.000
a great question. So, you know, a lot of stuff we look at because the code is very, you know,
1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:55.800
old, we can't change it. A lot of stuff we do are going to be what we call proof of concept. We have
1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:59.960
to try it out first to see if it's going to work. So, a lot of these guys, the smart guys that are
1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:05.400
not talking right now are behind the scenes. They're looking at virtualization, if it's applicable.
1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:10.280
We're looking at, you know, moving the Oracle database, which is the biggest improvement we've
1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:16.760
seen over the last year to new hardware. And the type of outages you guys have now is different.
1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:22.680
So, with moving the database to TMS, the type of outages we have recover really quickly. Before
1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:27.800
we do that. And if you wouldn't mind, when we say recover quickly. So, organically the system
1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:34.040
repairs itself? No, no. So, what I mean is the database is still up, but other web components
1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:38.920
or services are down. All they need to be done is restarting. But when the database is not
1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:44.600
working or not functioning, that is a longer process. And since we moved it to TMS, the
1:08:44.600 --> 1:08:49.480
database has been almost 100% rock solid. So, that means a lot of the outages we have are
1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:54.440
different type of outages maybe compared to two years ago. I'm only just guessing that because
1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:59.240
we moved it, we've seen the improvement. So, the type of outages we have right now are significantly
1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:05.320
less interruption time as probably before maybe two or three years ago. So, we're continuously
1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:10.280
looking at different ways without messing up the code, without taking down Cal access. So,
1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:13.880
we just brainstorm. So, there's a lot of things we're looking at. But again, this is all proof of
1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:18.600
concept because it's not supported code. No one wants to touch it. No vendor wants to touch it.
1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:21.800
So, we really have to think outside the box when it comes to that.
1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:27.000
And just a couple more questions. So, at some point, there's an alert, right? And you've
1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.200
sort of outlined how many there are in average month. But that requires some level of human
1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:37.320
intervention at some point. So, what's, is it 24-7 support? What level of support do you have?
1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.880
If it's during a workday, I assume somebody's there. But on weekends, night, what happens?
1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:50.120
I'll give you an example. If we have an alert at 12 o'clock in the morning, the system comes up,
1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:54.680
we have somebody say, hey, if we have a channel, can someone reboot the server? Because it hasn't
1:09:54.680 --> 1:10:00.200
responded. We have somebody that manually go in and reboot it. So, it is our best effort 24x7.
1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:04.440
The monitoring capabilities, it gives us real-time access to see when the system is down or not
1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:09.480
responding. And then, a couple of times, we have to interact with that. But yes, we have people who
1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:17.240
are constantly, you know, getting these alerts and asking other members of the team to restart
1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:21.880
their service to bring it back up. So, it's a very manual process. It's not automated. And IT,
1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:27.000
we like automation. We tend to like that. But with this system, our hands are tied behind the back.
1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:31.480
We really can't do automation. So, it's a very manual process we do. It's the best effort. And
1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:37.480
as we grow as IT, we have more resources, more resources coming on that can help facilitate
1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:42.920
these changes. So, it's not unlikely that a member of the public or somebody at the FVPC and access
1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:47.960
to the system might be the first person to discover that there's an outage or a data
1:10:47.960 --> 1:10:52.920
interruption. So, is there a facility for the public to alert your staff, your tech team,
1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:57.080
that there's a problem with the system that they're not getting? I would say that we would
1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:00.600
probably already know. For example, if a person, I give you a hypothetical
1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:08.680
realistic, if we're working on rebooting the system, a customer might be trying to access it
1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:14.920
and it's temporarily available. And by the time they reach out to us, it's already resolved and
1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:22.360
recovered. It's restored. We see the system. And so, your question was, there's a mechanism for
1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:28.840
contacting. I don't think there is a tool or mechanism to contact us, but we're alerted
1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:34.760
on the system. And most likely, if there's interruption, most likely it's being rebooted. So,
1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:39.320
there's chance that customers like, hey, I cannot get to this web page or the CalXS and then two
1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:43.640
minutes later, it's up again. I appreciate it. So, most likely. So, if I'm using the system and I
1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:48.520
can't get a result, it is most likely that somebody's aware of the problem. Correct. But it's not
1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:55.000
guaranteed. It's not guaranteed. Okay. So, getting back to kind of the larger question. So, looking
1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:00.040
forward, if we stipulate that 24 to 36 months from now, you'll have a new system in place,
1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:07.480
battle tested. What can we do in the interim? Right? I mean, that's a long interval for people to
1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:11.400
have challenges accessing, you know, what should be very transparent information.
1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:15.000
Yeah. So, again, you're again, I think the thing we're talking about is, first of all, making sure
1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:21.160
that we have reliability on it if something goes down. Again, trying to test out some of the proof
1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:26.280
of concept we have was, you know, breaking up different services into their own entities.
1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:30.360
What I mean by that is just kind of looking at how the code is and see what we can do as far as
1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:35.800
resources. That's our biggest thing right now. So, again, we have to try out. We have a couple things
1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:41.320
that, you know, that we want to try in the future to see if it can enhance it. The stability, you
1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:45.240
know, for us is the recovery time. We're going to have allergies. I mean, that's just the system it
1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:50.440
is. But what we try to do is have as minimal as possible. The most significant one, I keep going
1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:54.440
back to it because these are the ones that we really have no controller at this point, is really
1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:59.800
trying to come up with a second path to the database if that path goes down. I believe
1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:04.440
that the number of outages as far as how long they're out will be significantly reduced. So,
1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:10.520
we would get a lot of people who may not call in because the system hasn't been down for over 24
1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:16.920
hours. That's just my opinion and my observation. No, I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah. Terrific.
1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:22.280
Thank you, Secretary Weber. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today and all the
1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:27.960
leadership and frustrations that come with the job that you have been appointed to quite appropriately.
1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:33.000
We're going to continue to... Can I add one thing? I just want to thank you for your honesty,
1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.080
right, for your candor in this. I mean, that is refreshing when it comes to these things for
1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:42.120
somebody to actually sit up here, take responsibility, you know, admit what needs fixing and propose to
1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:45.960
fix it. So, I appreciate that. But my mama said, if you tell a lie, you have to put legs on it to
1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:51.640
make it stand up. So, it's a constant job to keep a lie alive. You tell the same over and over.
1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:55.240
That's the mom from Arkansas, right? That's the Arkansas stuff, you know.
1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:00.440
You were touching those roots. Well, thank you guys for having us. I mean, I appreciate it. It's
1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:06.920
been a journey. I can tell you that. It's been a journey. But I think this team is so committed to
1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:11.640
making this work. I mean, the fact that they're 24-7 is really true. By the time I hear about
1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:18.360
anything that's been done and they're on it 24-7, they're increasing their team because I asked them,
1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:22.680
I said, you have to keep this thing alive. And they've taken that on. They've never been asked to
1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:28.600
do that before. And so, they're taking it on and looking at new ways to store the data, to working
1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:32.760
with the internet. All these kinds of things that they come to me and show me these projects that
1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:38.200
they have discovered will work to keep this thing alive. And that is reassuring as well as them
1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:43.000
working on the new project itself. Thank you. Thank you very much. And we look forward to maybe an
1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:47.960
update in the coming year. We hope to be able to give you that good update. Thank you. Thank you.
1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:51.960
Thanks. All right. I know we've run a little long there and we appreciate the patience of our
1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:56.440
witnesses to come. I'm going to ask them to consolidate their testimony. I want to invite
1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:02.840
Mr. Brian Metzger from the legislative analyst office to come join us.
1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:13.080
You don't need to stay, but your staff's always welcome to listen in. But it's up to you.
1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:18.520
Thank you. Okay. Let me invite Brian to come up. And Brian, as you're coming up,
1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:24.040
I know you had a presentation here and a lot of the data, the historical stuff has been covered.
1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:29.080
And so, I really would like you to focus in on some of the questions that you've heard us talk
1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:37.240
about. Come on up. Are you at the table or is he over there? Okay. We've benefited from your
1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:43.560
presentation that we've all reviewed in terms of the history. But maybe if you want to summarize
1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:48.600
that, you can. But really, we're looking forward. What lessons did you think we've learned? What did
1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:56.280
you hear today that worries you or inspires you? And going forward, I know that there's a road map
1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:03.400
which you've identified. What is it about that road map that has your ears and eyes at attention
1:16:03.400 --> 1:16:08.440
and ours as well? That's where if we could maybe jump off to that space if it's okay with you.
1:16:08.440 --> 1:16:12.840
Sure. Absolutely. Brian Metzger with the Legislative Analyst Office. Thanks for inviting us to testify
1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:18.520
today. You know, I think it would be helpful at least to cover a little bit of the project history.
1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:22.680
I know we've talked about perspective. We've talked about OSAS just to give a little bit
1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:26.840
of perspective about the project assessment. I think it informs what lessons we can learn
1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:33.560
and what the path forward is for this project. One thing that was mentioned is, you know,
1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:37.400
there were a number of flaws with the initial implementation of this project, some of which
1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:40.680
have been mentioned, but I just want to run through them because I think it's instructive for the
1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:45.960
next steps on this project. One of them was flawed testing activities. Some of the staff
1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:50.760
didn't know exactly what they were testing or were not prepared to test the system that was
1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:56.760
being developed. There was a reluctance to accept valid risks to the project's goals and objectives
1:16:56.760 --> 1:17:02.520
that were actually raised by internal stakeholders within SOS. And then system components that were
1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:07.800
being developed were so tightly coupled with the business rules that are required to actually run
1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:12.200
the system that when you needed to make a change in business rules, it would actually require changes
1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:16.600
across the entire system. And so there was no separate business rules engine that could actually
1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:24.200
be updated based on legislation or other changes that were made. I think the path forward has
1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:27.400
already been mentioned. There is a memorandum of understanding between the Department of
1:17:27.400 --> 1:17:32.360
Technology and the Secretary of State's office to voluntarily submit this project through the
1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:38.440
project approval life cycle. The stage one documentation, which is the business analysis,
1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:43.240
which provides the business goals for the project, has already been approved. And now the project
1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:48.040
is working on its stage two documentation, and that will give us the preliminary baseline cost,
1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:53.640
schedule, and scope for the project going forward. The Secretary of State's office is expecting that
1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:58.600
to be available spring of 2023, along with whatever budget request is going to be necessary to go
1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:08.920
into 2023-24. I think one of the lessons learned that is evident from reading the project assessment
1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:13.400
and looking at the project roadmap is that as the Secretary of State's office mentioned,
1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:20.120
working with the system integrator vendor is very important, but the ultimate authority
1:18:20.120 --> 1:18:24.440
and responsibility rests with the Secretary of State's office, that they need to be involved in
1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:30.760
the project, they need to be working alongside the vendor, but they ultimately need to be involved
1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:34.840
in making sure they're assessing risk and mitigating those risks as the project continues.
1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:41.080
We've also seen from the project roadmap that was submitted as part of the project assessment,
1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:48.200
an initial project cost that they estimate would be reasonable for this project and the range of
1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:56.200
$50 million and a development timeline of approximately 27 months. So were we to assume
1:18:56.200 --> 1:19:00.680
that given what the project approval life cycle looks like right now, which is supposed to end
1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:07.720
in spring of 2024, this project could be finished in sometime June 2026. So that's the kind of
1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:11.880
timeline we're looking at for this project. And happy to answer any other questions you might have.
1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:15.800
You heard, thank you. Thank you for that. Again, for the broader review that we've
1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:21.880
all read and seen that you were kind enough not to go through with us now, but we heard about the
1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:26.120
contracts that were offered up. Some of them were disclosed today. This is a contract with
1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:31.320
Prospecta with deliverables that they have argued were a part of that contract. Have you seen that
1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:36.360
contract? I have not. Okay. And obviously you would support the idea of a contract based on
1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:44.520
deliverables. Yes. Versus a time and materials contract. So if you look backwards now and say,
1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:50.600
well, where did we go wrong? It was projected at $11 million in 2016. I don't know if you found a
1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:57.960
flaw in those projections at that time. But what did we miss to have all these years go by
1:19:57.960 --> 1:20:06.680
where we're sitting here today really frustrated? Secretary is we are all now the cost of quadrupled
1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:12.520
or greater. What should we have learned from that? I mean, should the legislature be more
1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:19.240
attentive to those contracts when they're issued? Should we have reviews of those contracts of such
1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:23.880
significance so we just don't let them run its course and then find out years later that
1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:29.000
mistakes were made? Is there any lessons there? Yeah, I think the lesson learned from the initial
1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:35.240
contract was that Prospecta was trying to implement a commercial off the shelf solution
1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:39.800
for something that has really complex requirements. And so when you're trying to just take software
1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:44.920
you've developed and put it in and assume that it's going to work properly for something as complex
1:20:44.920 --> 1:20:50.200
as disclosure, campaign disclosure and lobbying statements. It's not necessarily going to work
1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:54.840
if you don't really take into account how much customization needs to be done. And so I think
1:20:54.840 --> 1:21:00.120
that over the years, the four years that Prospecta was the vendor, that really wasn't understood until
1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:06.600
the end when it was too late to actually address. And with OSAS it was just such a condensed timeline.
1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:10.840
You were talking about eight months to a year to implement something that over four years couldn't
1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:15.320
even be implemented. And so there was just not enough time and they really did not understand
1:21:15.320 --> 1:21:20.440
all of those complex requirements up front. So they underbid and overpromised. I think when you
1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:25.080
look forward about kind of the issue of oversight, I think certainly oversight of the contracts for
1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:30.680
these vendors is very important, understanding how the procurement was done, making sure that the
1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:35.800
procurement was done competitively, that there were multiple bidders, that there was in some
1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:40.680
cases proofs of concept as part of the procurement so you can test whether there are
1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:45.800
the correct scenarios that are going to be addressed by the solution that you're trying
1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:50.840
to procure. And that is something that is being done more routinely with today's IT projects as
1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:56.280
opposed to four or five years ago. But certainly I think watching the procurement, making sure you
1:21:56.280 --> 1:22:00.760
understand kind of what vendors are participating and asking for information about those contracts,
1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:06.920
whether they're fixed, you know, price contracts with deliverables and kind of gated reviews,
1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:12.360
those are all important things to ask as you go through even the budget process and you're looking
1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:17.640
at kind of the next year's appropriations. Right. Okay. Thank you, Senator Newman. Any questions?
1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:22.760
Yeah, it kind of comes back to the same question I asked of the Secretary. So,
1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:28.760
you know, what have we learned? How do we get through to, you know, that end date for the
1:22:28.760 --> 1:22:33.320
next implementation? And probably more importantly, how do we prevent this? I mean, Senator Gilles has
1:22:33.320 --> 1:22:37.560
raised a good question about contracts, but more generally, from your perspective,
1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:44.200
what's the big lesson here that we as legislators might apply either legislatively or through oversight?
1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:53.640
I think one of the big lessons is that using the state's IT project approval processes is
1:22:53.640 --> 1:22:59.000
important. I think one of the issues was that there was an exemption in the bill that was intended
1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:03.560
to expedite the development and implementation of this system. I think the project approval
1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:08.040
lifecycle that the project is going through now is a robust process and it involves multiple
1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:14.120
stakeholders. The legislature gets documentation at every stage of the process, so it can review
1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:19.320
those, it can understand what is being assumed, you know, what procurement is being used, what are
1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:23.800
the requirements, what are the objectives, it's all there in writing and it can be reviewed.
1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:29.640
I think exemptions cause a lack of transparency about what's going on as the project's being
1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:37.320
planned. I think lessons learned, it's really understanding those complex business requirements
1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:42.920
and technical requirements up front and making sure that the vendors are aware of that and being
1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:48.760
honest about any of the potential roadblocks that could be faced as they develop the system.
1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:53.080
I think there's too much optimism oftentimes with vendors that they can get things done
1:23:53.080 --> 1:24:00.120
on schedule and, you know, within budget. I think having a clear understanding of the contingency,
1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:04.360
really, what are our contingency plans, what is our rollback plan if this doesn't go according to
1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:10.040
plan, you know, and what kind of cost overruns can we anticipate. I think those are all of the
1:24:10.040 --> 1:24:15.160
lessons learned from this last iteration. And my last question said, do you feel like Mr.
1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:23.400
Metzger, that at this point, you know, again, to my question about it more generally, that you have
1:24:23.400 --> 1:24:29.320
enough visibility into this process, especially as it relates to responsibilities and progress
1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:33.480
at this point, that you'd feel comfortable? At this point, I would say that the Secretary
1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:37.720
of State's office has been very helpful in helping us understand where they are with the project
1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:42.440
currently. We've met with them several times. I would also say that we have discussions with
1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:46.840
Department of Technology about kind of their role in this process and our understanding of
1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:51.640
kind of what they're going to offer as they plan this project has been helpful. I think it's very
1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:56.440
early on in the planning stages, to be honest. We're only in stage one. We have the business
1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:01.000
goals. A lot of the stuff that's reusable has been put into that. We need to really see that
1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:05.480
preliminary cost schedule and scope. And that's part of that stage two documentation. We need to
1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:09.960
see the market research. We need to kind of get an understanding of kind of what solutions were
1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:16.120
considered and really have a firm understanding that all options were considered. And I think
1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:20.040
that will come in spring of 2023 and will certainly be there to look at it. Thank you.
1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:26.760
Thank you, Mr. Mesker. I just want to note the irony of the provision in that 2016 legislation
1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:33.880
that was meant to expedite the systems being implemented that gave them flexibility to move
1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:39.640
outside of the Department of Technology's standards has actually turned to be the complete opposite
1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:46.440
from your point of view in getting us into this sinkhole that we are in today. We're very good.
1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:49.720
Well, thank you. And thank you for your continued monitoring of this work. We appreciate it very
1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:54.840
much. Thank you. Thank you. I next want to invite up Ms. Lindsay Nakano. She's the
1:25:55.400 --> 1:26:00.520
Fair Political Praxis Commission Senior Legislative Counsel. Ms. Nakano, thank you for being a part
1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:06.520
of our conversation today. We again welcome your testimony. I encourage you to consolidate it as
1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:12.120
you appropriate given what we have heard already. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Senator Newman.
1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:16.920
Again, I'm Lindsay Nakano, Senior Legislative Counsel with the FPPC. Thank you for the opportunity
1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:23.000
to speak. Our comments today are forward-looking. We're looking forward to the upcoming replacement
1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:27.960
system and the improvements that it will create for the filing process and increased transparency.
1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:32.040
And the Commission agrees with Secretary Weber's comments today that we would rather take the
1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:37.640
time to ensure an excellent system rather than rush things and end up with a poor result. In
1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:42.760
its capacity consulting on the CARS project, the Commission has provided guidance on the legal
1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:47.880
requirements of the system, as well as detailed feedback throughout the many stages of the project,
1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:52.600
including during the testing process. Over the past several months, the Commission has been working
1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:57.480
to become an even more helpful, collaborative partner with the Secretary of State's office,
1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:01.800
including by gathering information about other jurisdictions' electronic filing systems
1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:06.040
that we think provide a good end product in order to be able to contribute a more educated
1:27:06.040 --> 1:27:10.440
perspective throughout the development of the system. Today, I'm going to briefly outline three
1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:15.000
general points of functionality that we look forward to in the new system that we think will
1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:19.800
create significant benefits. First, we look forward to the creation of a more intuitive system that
1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:24.760
will help ease the burden of compliance for filers. An important part of this is the fact that the
1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:30.200
system will be data-driven, which we understand to mean transaction-based, in contrast to our
1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:35.320
current system which is form-based. A data-driven transaction-based system would allow a candidate
1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:40.760
or committee to log into the system and input transactions, like contributions, expenditures,
1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:46.200
or loans, independent of any particular form. One of the benefits of this is that the filer would
1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:51.720
only need to input a particular transaction once, even if the transaction is required to be reported
1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:57.400
on more than one kind of statement or report. For regular campaign statements, ideally the system
1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:02.200
would alert filers when a report is coming due, and once all of the transactions are entered
1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:07.080
during a reporting period, the system would be designed to auto-populate reports with all the
1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:11.720
transactions covered during that period, and the filer would then be able to review their final
1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:15.880
report and file it, which would be possible with only a couple clicks of a mouse button.
1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:20.680
In order to make the new filing process as smooth as possible, the commission is also exploring a
1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:26.200
legislative proposal to streamline some of the technical requirements for signing and filing
1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:30.280
campaign statements in consultation with the Secretary of State's office. We are continuing
1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:35.000
to gather information on exactly what changes will be helpful and beneficial, and we will continue
1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:39.160
to explore and develop these solutions in the weeks leading up to the next legislative session.
1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:44.040
Second, we look forward to a new system that will improve the usability of the public-facing
1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:49.480
search website to increase transparency for the public. In particular, we look forward to a
1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:54.520
search system that presents information and data in an easily understandable format and that has
1:28:54.520 --> 1:29:00.040
robust filtering options and intuitive navigation. To learn more about what is possible in this area,
1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:05.480
Commission staff reviewed dozens of other campaign finance public search sites in other states.
1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:11.320
One example of another state that does this all very well is Idaho. Recognizing that California
1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:15.960
is a much larger state with more activity, we nonetheless hope that California will strive
1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:21.160
to create the best possible search tools, including by looking to other jurisdictions for inspiration
1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:25.640
that will help the public make sense of the massive amounts of information that will be contained in
1:29:25.640 --> 1:29:32.280
the system. Third and last, we look forward to a new system that will be flexible and will allow
1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:36.760
for future improvements to the filing schedule and related reporting requirements. Due to the age
1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:40.760
of the current system, as we know, it has limited ability to accommodate changes to the reporting
1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:46.600
and filing requirements and changes that can be made often require significant costs. After the
1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:51.960
new system is certified, there will almost certainly be legislative changes to the reporting
1:29:51.960 --> 1:29:56.280
requirements in subsequent years and the Commission believes that it is crucial that the new system
1:29:56.280 --> 1:30:01.720
is built to be flexible to accommodate these changes. One of those future legislative changes
1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:06.360
may potentially include redesigning the campaign filing schedule to go into effect sometime after
1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:12.280
CARS is certified. We think the new system will present an opportunity to re-evaluate the campaign
1:30:12.280 --> 1:30:16.520
finance filing schedule. Our current filing schedule was built over time, as you know, as a
1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:21.160
result of many pieces of legislation, and our staff thinks that we will be approaching a period where
1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:26.360
it will be both possible and greatly beneficial to redesign our filing schedule in a holistic way
1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:30.280
based on best practices and taking advantage of the new technology that will become available.
1:30:31.240 --> 1:30:35.320
The Commission is just beginning to explore and start conversations in this area,
1:30:35.320 --> 1:30:39.000
and we anticipate it will be a multi-year discussion on long-term project.
1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:43.240
Thank you again to this committee for your time and attention and for holding this hearing today.
1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:48.760
Thank you, Mr. Kano. A couple questions for me. Were you consulted on the decision to not make the
1:30:50.040 --> 1:30:55.480
reboot occur in June of 2021? Were you consulted on that, the Commission?
1:30:55.480 --> 1:31:00.040
I'm not aware of whether we were consulted before the announcement was made. I do know that the
1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:06.440
Commission supported and sent a letter supporting the 2019 delay in the system.
1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:12.440
You don't know whether you were consulted on this last decision to not go live in 2021?
1:31:13.640 --> 1:31:18.840
Not before the decision was made. And was the Commission or consulted at all on the contracts
1:31:18.840 --> 1:31:24.840
that were performed for this reboot?
1:31:24.840 --> 1:31:31.400
I'm not aware. I was not with the Commission at that time. I could consult with staff and
1:31:32.120 --> 1:31:35.240
provide that information. As a part of the legislation, the Hertzberg
1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:40.920
legislation in 2016 was that the Secretary work in partnership with the FPPC on this work.
1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:46.840
So I'm interested in knowing whether that happened or not. Going backwards, I know you've laid out
1:31:46.840 --> 1:31:51.400
the standards that you'd like to see going forward, but we're trying to learn also from what happened
1:31:51.400 --> 1:31:55.320
and be interested in knowing whether the Commission was consulted on any of those contracts
1:31:56.200 --> 1:32:00.840
and on the decision to not go forward. And maybe subsequent follow-up, you can let us know.
1:32:00.840 --> 1:32:04.920
Senator Newman, any questions? Just real quickly to your third point about
1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:08.520
flexibility of the new system, Mr. Kono. Thank you, by the way, for being here today.
1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:12.280
When you say possibly redesigning, the final schedule will be more flexible.
1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:17.880
I assume you mean to provide greater real-time insight or do you mean something else?
1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:24.520
We envision looking at the filing schedule as a whole, looking at other jurisdictions,
1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:29.880
what they do in order to streamline the filing schedule for filers while also maintaining
1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:34.680
high transparency. So what that could look like is reducing some of the activity-based
1:32:34.680 --> 1:32:39.240
reporting. So that's the on-demand reporting that's earlier in the year and increasing
1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:43.400
regular reporting, for example, to monthly or something similar. So that way there is regular
1:32:43.400 --> 1:32:49.560
reporting. It's easier for filers to anticipate when their reports will be due while also maintaining
1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:55.000
that transparency for filers on a regular schedule. And then, you know, with respect to sort of a
1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:59.400
more transactional approach, I assume that's inclusive, right? So that would make it much
1:32:59.400 --> 1:33:05.960
easier for a campaign to have their data in the system to close out a reporting period, correct?
1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:08.440
That's correct, yes. Got it. That makes sense. Thank you.
1:33:08.440 --> 1:33:12.280
Great. Thank you, Senator Newman. Thank you, Mr. Kono, for being a part of the conversation today.
1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:16.360
Thank you. All right. We want to invite next. We have three speakers representing organizations
1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:21.880
that use Cal Access to file reports. First, we're going to hear from a speaker representing the
1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:27.640
California Political Treasures Association. Ms. Stacy Owens is a board member of that group,
1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:32.120
and she's going to be joining us remotely. Ms. Owens, welcome to our hearing, and you
1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:35.400
can hear us. Hopefully we can hear you. You're ready to go.
1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:37.880
Yes, yes. If you can hear me, we're ready to go.
1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:44.040
Yes, we can. And I have been actually editing my presentation as we go along,
1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:49.080
so that I don't take up too much of your time. I thank you for inviting us at the CPTA.
1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:56.360
I just wanted to briefly explain who we are. The California Political Treasures Association
1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:03.880
is the only Treasures Association industry group in the entire country. We're the only state who
1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:13.000
has one of these. We meet regularly, quarterly, and excuse me, share best practices along with
1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:18.920
discussing new regulations and what you would expect, things of interest to our community.
1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:26.120
And so, of course, Cal Access has been a huge, huge point of discussion at the Political Treasures
1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:34.280
Association. Some challenges that we have in our industry is that we are very niche.
1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:40.840
There are not many people who do what we do because it's a combination of compliance and
1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:45.320
accounting. So, we have to understand regulation. We have to be able to
1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:53.160
make sure that what our clients are doing is proper and legal in real time in the middle
1:34:53.160 --> 1:34:57.640
of heated campaigns. In addition to that, we need to be keeping all of their accounting data like
1:34:57.640 --> 1:35:02.280
you would for any normal bookkeeper for any business, and we have to be able to file all
1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:10.040
of these forms. And in the state of California, in many jurisdictions. So, ultimately, a point
1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:15.800
of discussion at our association has been that we would love to get to a place in the future
1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:22.440
where the Secretary of State is the only filing officer, and we can file all in one place. I
1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:28.120
think that that would create a lot more transparency to the public at large, and it would also
1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:33.960
make it easier to know where to file. In some cases, it can be difficult to know who our filing
1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:45.240
officer is. And so, with that being said, it's really of interest to us that the Cal Access project
1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:53.160
is implemented very well, and that it is implemented using softwares and processes
1:35:53.160 --> 1:36:01.080
that we already are using. We have industry software, we have net files, statecraft, ISP,
1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:07.720
Aristotle, NGP. These are softwares that we count on to be able to put in our data,
1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:13.240
and not only for filing with you, but for, you know, making sure that all the transactions
1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:18.200
are in, reconciling our bank statements, giving reports to our clients so that they understand,
1:36:18.200 --> 1:36:24.040
at any point in a campaign, where they are with their budget. These are important softwares to us,
1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:30.920
and whatever is implemented needs to be able to work with those softwares and those systems that
1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:37.880
we already have in place. And on that note, you're going to hear me saying that file again.
1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:48.600
But we at the association would like to point out that net file is the main software for
1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:55.160
city and county filers in the state. So, they're not only the software that we are using often
1:36:55.160 --> 1:37:00.680
on the professional treasurer side, but they're also the software that we are filing into when
1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:06.360
we file with, you know, San Francisco, Oakland, et cetera. They seem to have a system that's
1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:17.160
already working. And we have been asking along the way in this process if the secretary of state,
1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:25.480
the FPPC, everybody who's involved, could work more closely with net file to create this new
1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:32.440
filing system, because it works. And it works on the other end, too. It works for the public. We
1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:39.560
often need to look up, you know, did this filing go through. It's instantaneous to go on to
1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:44.920
Oakland or San Francisco or, you know, any of the other net file cities and counties,
1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:49.640
you know, type in the ID number of the committee, type in the name of the committee, type in a
1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:56.200
partial name of the committee, and instantly get access to the filings. You can see donors. It's
1:37:56.200 --> 1:38:04.120
a beautiful search system. So, you know, I think that my biggest takeaway from this system is,
1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:13.960
is that we have something that works. At least it works on a smaller scale. And it's, it would be
1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:19.960
very nice, in our opinion, as a treasurer's association, if we could scale that and have
1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:24.520
something similar on the state level. Great. I think people here in the hearing room are taking
1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:32.920
notes, so thank you for making that point. Thank you. Anything else, Ms. Owens? Nothing from me,
1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:37.640
unless anyone has questions, but absolutely the position about the CPTA.
1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:45.160
Actually, real quickly, we can get to it later to, I guess, Mr. Cormier, about that suggestion
1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:49.960
and whether or not we'll get to it later. Yeah, let's hold it. Let's put a pin on it. We'll come
1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:54.600
back to it. Ms. Owens, thank you. It's good to see you here at, for full disclosure, your firm
1:38:54.600 --> 1:39:00.040
works for me and one of my committees, and I'm happy to see you are the designator from the
1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:04.440
Treasurer's Association to participate today. So, thank you for all your wisdom and knowledge.
1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:09.880
Thank you for inviting us. I appreciate it. Terrific. Okay, we're going to now invite Ms.
1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:16.040
Lacey Keyes, President of the California Political Attorneys Association, to provide some testimony
1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:20.760
today. She's here in the hearing room. You've heard the conversation that has taken place,
1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:24.440
and hopefully you can enhance it versus repeat it. Thank you for being here. Thank you,
1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:29.400
Chairman Glazier, Senator Newman. I want to reiterate the thank you for the opportunity
1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:35.160
for the Political Attorneys Association to provide some comments, to give some context to my
1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:40.040
participation, in addition to my work with CPIA. I've been part of what was called the
1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:45.400
Stakeholder Input Group, which is the industry folks who participated with SOS and the various
1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:50.280
contractors to provide feedback. I was also a beta tester of the system, one of the third-party
1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:56.120
people that actually got to go in and kick the wheels a little bit. So, my comments have scratched
1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:01.000
out the ones people have already said, and I've focused them on what we hope to see in the new
1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.800
system, which is informed by some of the challenges we saw with the prior iteration of cars.
1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:13.560
So, the first comment I'll make is that CPIA hopes to see the system recognize that the vast
1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:20.120
majority of users are not one-off campaigns entering their own data real-time in the state system to
1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:26.120
prepare filings, but I think Netfile, the vendor that was mentioned, has done an analysis, and it's
1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:34.520
upwards 85% or more of the system users use third-party software. Most of them use either CPTA,
1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:41.480
CPIA-type vendors, and I mention that because the first version of the system was very much
1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:46.280
developed with a mindset that the individual treasurer is going to track every contribution in
1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:51.480
the state system and then hit submit the reports, and as a practical matter, most people are not
1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:57.320
going to be putting data into the system until it's filing time. So, that just piggybacks on
1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:02.840
Stacey's comments about really having a system that works with those third-party vendors so
1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:08.600
that we can submit data when it's time. There were some issues with the prior version where
1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:12.600
there was a notion the data would have to be submitted before we could even see what our
1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:17.320
filings would look like, which caused great concern to the attorneys who are responsible
1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:22.360
for making sure everything's accurate, and the software vendors can provide more detail on that
1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:27.000
in the input process, but just flagging that, it's actually very important from kind of a legal
1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:34.200
perspective. Our second high point relates to signature verification. The prior version was
1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:38.920
kind of built out with the assumption that everyone who signs a report is going to go through a
1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:44.520
multi-factor authentication process, which means the governor would have to do that to sign his
1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:50.520
campaign reports, someone running for city council, as well as every sponsor of a committee, and so
1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:56.280
just making sure that, again, in recognition of our vendor industry that we're authorizing vendors
1:41:56.280 --> 1:42:00.840
so that then we can do what we need to do for the filers and they can worry about their campaigns.
1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:08.520
A couple other comments I wanted to highlight, so it's already been mentioned, the vendors,
1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:13.080
but one of the things we saw was the vendors in the prior system didn't know anything about
1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:18.120
California reporting requirements, and so the regulated community would say, well, we need to
1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:24.040
be able to do X because the statute requires us to do X, and that feedback wasn't really being
1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:29.560
taken into consideration and development, so whether the primary vendor has California experience
1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:33.880
or they're brought in as a consultant, there's a lot of valuable experience that exists in
1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:41.720
California that can be tapped as a resource. In terms of testing, regular users like myself
1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:47.080
and others were able to test early on and provide feedback, and I think that was valuable to helping
1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:51.720
the Secretary of State's office realize that we were not ready for go live, and I would encourage
1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:56.920
that process to continue earlier rather than later, since we're the folks that are going to identify
1:42:56.920 --> 1:43:05.160
a lot of the nuances that can be fixed. Speaking of feedback, one of the challenges in the last
1:43:05.160 --> 1:43:11.880
iteration with the third party project manager was we would provide feedback and then never hear
1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:17.240
about it again, and a lot of that feedback was not taken, so I would encourage kind of as we're
1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:23.000
thinking about the process to have a system to track that feedback and actually circle back to it.
1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:28.520
I know SOS's staff tried to implement that at the end with OSAS, but it was kind of too late for
1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:33.880
them to be able to do that, and then one other item that hasn't been raised but I think is an
1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:40.440
important one is the current system, and I think the way that CARS 1.0 was being developed still
1:43:40.440 --> 1:43:47.000
required a lot of human intervention by Secretary of State staff, and I'll give a practical example.
1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:54.280
A lobby registration renewals were due in December of 2020, and data related to those
1:43:54.280 --> 1:44:00.600
registrations as late as last month still hadn't been manually entered by the team at SOS on Cal
1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:06.120
Access, so if a filer changed their address, for example, the old address was still on there,
1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:11.400
and that's by no means a reflection on the staff. They have so much work and they work very hard,
1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:16.920
but we should be able to update our registration information and have the system automatically
1:44:16.920 --> 1:44:22.600
accepted upon e-filing, so things like practical things like that we'd like to see in the system.
1:44:22.600 --> 1:44:26.920
So that's all I have in terms of my prepared comments that I don't think had been previously
1:44:27.560 --> 1:44:33.160
stated. Thank you, all very helpful and informative, certainly the feedback on the testing,
1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:41.160
and as well as the lack of feedback from the project manager that you experienced. Again,
1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:45.640
I'd never heard of the firm perspective before this hearing. It seemed to indicate they're not
1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:51.160
California based, and therefore weren't aware of our rules and regulations. That was my takeaway.
1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:56.120
I can't speak to where they're domiciled, but just our experience and back and forth with them,
1:44:56.120 --> 1:45:00.680
we talked to them about 24-hour reporting, and it was like they had no idea about the different
1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:05.960
requirements. Terrific. Senator Newman, any questions? No, no question, but thank you very much. Thank
1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:09.880
you for your time. Thank you. Thank you very much. We're going to move on to John Valencia,
1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:13.880
representing the California Institute of Governmental Advocates. John is chair of the
1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:20.200
Institute's legislative committee. Mr. Valencia, as I understand it, lobbyists have been paying for
1:45:20.200 --> 1:45:26.840
this upgrade for quite a while now. Since the beginning, Senator. Yes, so you have a stake in it
1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:32.040
both ways, both as a contributor to the system as well as wanting a system that's responsive to you.
1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:35.720
So we welcome your session. Thank you for the invitation to appear. Good morning, Mr. Chair,
1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:41.240
Senator Newman. IGA, the Institute of Governmental Advocates, was founded in 1974,
1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:46.440
immediately following the enactment of the Act. The Act, the Political Reform Act,
1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:51.640
has three major constituencies, public officials in their public official capacity,
1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:59.480
campaign committees and lobbyists, lobbyist firms and lobbyist employers, whether those are clients
1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:08.920
or in-house lobbyist employers for individuals in that capacity. Our reporting, our compliance,
1:46:08.920 --> 1:46:14.920
is infinitely simpler and our organization doesn't believe that we should be dependent on a cottage
1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:23.160
industry of third-party technology intermediaries. Ideally, in our world in California, we should
1:46:23.160 --> 1:46:30.040
be able to log on with a specified account hosted by the Secretary of State to file registrations,
1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:37.560
file amendments, file updates that are very simple, additions, deletions, quarterly reports and the
1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:45.880
like, which are vastly different than the regularity and the frequency and the magnitude of campaign
1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:53.720
reporting. It's obvious that the transparency sought by the Act is not going to be achieved
1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:58.760
unless there's a simple, at least in our corner of the regulated field, unless there's a simple and
1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:05.000
intuitive site hosted by the Secretary of State that allows us to comply, not only with existing
1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:11.480
law, but with some technological overlays that are a function of legislation. On a policy front,
1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:18.440
we have two recommendations. First, respectfully, we recommend that the legislature pause adding
1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:24.840
additional legislative legal requirements that translate into technological overlays and requirements
1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:30.040
for a system that's under reconstruction. I think you heard a prior speaker speak to that
1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:36.600
and several offer cautions on that front. Senate Bill 459 from the just concluded session, which
1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:44.520
moved through this committee, imposes time-sensitive disclosure requirements, 48 hours, but given the
1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:50.600
timeframes that you're hearing from the Secretary of State and the terms within that statute,
1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:58.520
we'll be fortunate to see that measure implemented by 2030, if that. So the system, because it's
1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:04.600
a matter of law, will have to accommodate that in order for it, at some point, within a year of
1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:10.760
the certification of the system, be able to accommodate the new requirement for exigent filings.
1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:17.800
So we urge the legislature, the various stakeholders, the FPPC, to just take a pause and let the new
1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:23.080
system come into existence. And we see the new system development providing an opportunity.
