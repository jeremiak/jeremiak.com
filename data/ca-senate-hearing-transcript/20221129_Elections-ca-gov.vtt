00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:51.197
HERTZBERG ARGUED THAT HIS

COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WAS. THE

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.162
SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THE COST

SPECIFIC DIRECTION IN THAT

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.184
LEGISLATION WAS THAT IT WOULD BE

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.719
OPERATIONAL. OPERATIONAL IN TWO

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.821
THOUSAND NINETEEN. THEY GAVE THE

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:50.990
ROOM FOR THE SECRETARY TO DELAY

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:53.025
I THINK UP TO SIX MONTHS IF THEY

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.994
FELT THE SYSTEM WASN'T READY TO

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:57.363
GO. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SO

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.600
AS WE KNOW. THAT THAT DID NOT.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:04.070

THE SYSTEM. WAS ESTABLISHED IN

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:16.115

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.287
YEAR WE HAD TWO POINT THREE

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:56.589
BILLION. IN CAMPAIGN

00:10:56.655 --> 00:11:01.427

THREE EIGHT NINE MILLION

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:04.130
CONTRIBUTORS. SO FROM WHEN THE

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:06.198
SYSTEM WAS FIRST ENVISIONED AND

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:09.101

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.804
FOUR FOLD INCREASE. IN CAMPAIGN

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:17.076
TRIPLING OF INDIVIDUAL DONORS

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.544
THAT THE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:20.312
TRACK I THOUGHT THAT WAS.

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:23.916
INTERESTING FACTOIDS THAT IT

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.684
PUTS THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE. THAT

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.920
WE DO KNOW THAT THAT THIS IS

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.656
THAT THE SECRETARY- MADE A

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:33.793
DECISION IN NINETEEN TO DELAY-

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.694
AT THE CURRENT SECRETARY WEBER.

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.797
MADE A THOUGHTFUL DECISION IN

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:38.330
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT THE

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:40.966
SYSTEM WAS NOT READY TO BE

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:43.803
IMPLEMENTED ALL THE WORK THAT

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:45.538
HAS BEEN DONE. WAS FOR NOT THIS

00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:47.573
OF COURSE COMES AFTER THE

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.942
LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED IN. THE AT

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:52.445
THE PROJECT COULD SPEND OVER

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:54.447
THIRTY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS.

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:55.548
SO IT'S MY HOPE THAT THIS

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.550
HEARING TODAY FROM THE SECRETARY

00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:59.452

JUST ON THE SURFACE THAT- CARS

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.289

ONE. AND THE END OF JUNE TWENTY

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:14.159
TWENTY ONE THAT WOULD BE A

SUICIDE. WHO I DON'T HAVE TO

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:24.069

OVER AND IT'S GOING TO BE

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:27.372
SUCCESSFUL- SHORTLY THERE AFTER

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:28.507
AS I POINTED OUT TO- ALL THE

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:30.242
LEADERSHIP AND IT MEMBERS WHEN I

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.743
MET WITH THEM AS A BECAME

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.512
SECRETARY STATE AND I'M NOT SURE

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:36.114
IF IT WAS A GOOD THING TO SAY OR

00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:37.549
NOT BUT I SAID TO THEM. THERE'S

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:39.585
NOTHING I HATE MORE THAN SOMEONE

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:41.019
WHO SAYS TO ME AFTER THE FACT. I

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:43.055
STARTED TO TELL YOU BUT- AND

00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:44.957
THEN THEY DIDN'T AND AS A RESULT

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:46.959
OF THAT THEY DIDN'T TELL ME AND-

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:48.193
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I DIDN'T WANT

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.962
TO HEAR IT OR THAT THEY JUST

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:52.164
DIDN'T WANT TO. REVEAL THINGS AT

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.699
THAT POINT SO THAT WAS A

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:54.867
STATEMENT I MADE TO MY STAFF.

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:56.235
AND THE NEW STAFF IN THE END AS

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:59.104
WELL AS THE CURRENT STAFF SOS.

00:18:59.171 --> 00:18:59.705
AND IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE STARTED

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:02.574
TO TELL ME. OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.877
HOPED I WOULDN'T HERE. AND THOSE

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:06.111
WERE THE THINGS AND WITH REGARDS

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:08.680
TO. THE ISSUES OF DATA

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.115
MIGRATION. THE HIGH NUMBER OF

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.817
TESTING THE FIX. THE NEGATIVE

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:12.451
FEEDBACK FROM THE USER

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:14.720
COMMUNITY. AND THOSE KINDS OF

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:16.655
THINGS- WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE

00:19:16.722 --> 00:19:18.991
DATA AND WE AND I MET WITH ALL

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.826
OF THOSE THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:22.628
THE PROJECT- IT WAS CLEAR THAT

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:24.029
THERE WAS. NOT A PERSON WHO WAS

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:25.631
IN DEFENSE OF THE SYSTEM- EVEN

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:27.466
THOSE WHO INITIALLY SAID YES

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.368
IT'S READY TO GO. BY THE TIME WE

00:19:29.434 --> 00:19:31.570
BEGAN TO ASK QUESTIONS AND

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:33.005
CONTINUE TO PROBE INTO IT

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:34.106
WHETHER THEY WERE. DIRECTLY

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:35.574
INVOLVED OR INDIRECTLY INVOLVED

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.009
WITH THE SYSTEM. ALL OF THEM

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:38.343
RESOLVED AT THE POINT THAT JUNE

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.878
THIRTIETH THAT WAS UNREALISTIC

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:41.246
THAT THEY WERE NOT READY IT WAS

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:43.382
NOT READY TO GO LIVE- THERE WAS

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:44.650
NO USER TESTING ABOVE FORTY

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.652
PERCENT- WITH REGARDS IN TERMS

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:48.587
OF ACCEPTANCE AND SO AS A RESULT

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.289
WE- AND IT WAS NOT GOING TO GET

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:52.124
THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.991
EFFORT TO. TO TEST AGAIN AND

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:54.893
AGAIN AND AGAIN. SO IT BECAME

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.562
CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE WAS NO

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:58.030
CONFIDENCE IN. IN THE READING

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.998
THIS TO LOCK THE SYSTEM- I COULD

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:00.999
HAVE DONE THE POLITICALLY

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:02.868
CORRECT THING ALONSO SYSTEM. FAN

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:04.102
BLAMES EVERYBODY ELSE FOR ITS

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:07.706
FAILURES- AND- AND BUT I.

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:08.607
THOUGHT CALIFORNIA DESERVE

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:10.542
BETTER. AND AS A RESULT WE

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:12.177
PROCEEDED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:13.545
WHAT WAS WRONG. AND WHAT WE

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:16.148
COULD DO. WE HI AS I SAID WE

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.649
ASKED EVERYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:18.951
WITH THE SYSTEM WHO WAS.

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:19.518
TECHNICALLY WORKING ON THE

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:20.953
SYSTEM WIDELY CONSULTED THE

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:21.987
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.422
TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS NOT REALLY

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:25.290
INVOLVED WITH THE SYSTEM- BUT I

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:26.391
THOUGHT THE WORD. COULD HAVE

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:28.260
BEEN AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:29.461
THEY WEREN'T. BASED ON THE

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:30.462
STRUCTURE OF THE KINDS OF THINGS

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.364
THAT WERE TAKING PLACE- SO WE

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.066
HAD TO THEN ASK THE QUESTION HOW

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:36.034
DO WE WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:37.235
BECAUSE I ASKED THE QUESTION

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:38.437
HOUSE. HOW SOON WOULD BE READY

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:40.339
NO ONE KNEW. WHERE ARE WE IN THE

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:45.377
PROCESS NO. ONE COULD SAY WITH

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:46.278
STAGE THREE AND WE NEED TO GET

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.113
EIGHT FOUR. WHAT THE SERMON.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.815
THEY TO DO YOU. NO ONE COULDN'T

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:51.083
ME THAT THE THING WOULD. AND

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:52.250
THAT CONCERNING TO ME. AS WHICH

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:54.319
TO MOVE FORWARD- MY RESPONSE WAS

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:55.721
WITH INPUT FROM CALIFORNIA

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:57.022

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.390
MADE WHAT PROVED TO BE APPROVED

00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:00.125
DECISION TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:02.260
ASSESSMENT OF THE SYSTEM- AT THE

00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:04.062
SYSTEM'S READINESS TO DETERMINE

00:21:04.129 --> 00:21:06.031
THE FUTURE COURSE. OF ACTION TO

ENSURE THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.635
OF THE CARS PROJECT. SO RATHER

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.236
THAN CONTINUING DOWN A ROAD THAT

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:13.505
NO ONE KNEW WHERE WE WERE GOING-

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:15.107
I DECIDED AT THAT POINT WE NEED

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.642
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WERE.

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.510
WHERE WE IN THIS PROCESS AND HOW

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.612
DO WE GET BACK TO. RESOLVING THE

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:22.848
ISSUE AND HOW DO WE GET CARS

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:24.883
MOVING AGAIN- I PAUSE THE

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.785
ONGOING DEVELOPMENT WORK EXCEPT

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:27.919
FOR SOME DATA PREPARATION

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.454
ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE USEFUL

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:31.323
FOR BOTH THE CURRENT. AND OR

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.291
FUTURE PROJECT ACTIVITIES- WE

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:34.426
PARTED WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:35.761

REVIEW PROCESS. SENATE I SHOULD

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:47.606
MENTION ALL OF THIS AND ONCE WE

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:49.107
HAD HAD THIS CONVERSATION MADE

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:49.841
SOME DETERMINATIONS AND LOOKED

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:52.110
AROUND. WE ALSO MADE SURE THAT

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:53.879
THE- THE GOVERNOR. OF THE

00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:55.213
LEADERS IN BOTH HOUSES WERE

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.315
AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE.

00:21:57.382 --> 00:21:58.383
AND THE FACT THAT WE WERE

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.352
POSTPONING THE LAUNCH AND WITH

PROJECT THAT WE WERE TRYING TO.

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:31.483
GET THE PROJECT OFF AND- AND

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.984
THOSE MANAGEMENT ISSUES NEED TO

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:34.386
BE ADDRESSED IF WE WERE ACTUALLY

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:35.520
TO MOVE FORWARD WE CAN JUST

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:37.022
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AS IF

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.057
THERE HAD BEEN NO ISSUES WITHIN

TIME. AND I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.098
THE QUESTION THAT'S THE YEAR.

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:48.433
LET ME SAY THIS THAT WE HAVE

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.702
LEARNED MUCH FROM OUR PAST

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:52.303
EXPERIENCES WITH THE DIETS OF

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.238
MUCH OF THE ACTIONS WE'RE

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:54.773
DISCUSSING TODAY. YOU KNOW WHEN

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.741
I SAY THAT I ASKED EVERYONE IN

ITSELF AND WHAT'S GOING ON AND

00:28:01.112 --> 00:28:03.081
WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT OF IT. I

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:04.182
DISCOVERED THAT MOST OF THE

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:06.184
FOLKS IN ESTO ES HAD NO INTO

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:08.720
CONTACT A COMMITMENT TO THE

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:09.721
PROJECT ITSELF. BUT IT RELIED

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.589
HEAVILY UPON OUTSIDE INDIVIDUALS

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:12.957
TO WORK TO RUN THE PROJECT AND

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:15.193
THAT OUR OWN PEOPLE INSIDE. NOT

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.128
ONLY IN OUR I. T. DEPARTMENT BUT

ENGAGEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT WITH

00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:23.268
THE PROJECT ITSELF. SO THEREFORE

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:24.602
IT MAY CAN DIFFICULT TO

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:27.572

IT AND THAT THEY COULD DO THE

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:19.117

MONEY THAT'S BEEN SPENT. OVER

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:27.625
THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE OUR

00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:30.094
DATA SHOWS US. THAT WE HAVE

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:31.963
COME- DURING THE DURING THE

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.465
POLICY PERIOD- WE HAD TEN

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:36.401
MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS WAS AT

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:38.269
THE BEGINNING. OF THE OF THE

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.405
PROJECT BEFORE IT WAS PAUSED AND

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:42.307
IN JUNE JULY- SEVEN MILLION WAS

00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:44.742
SPENT- AND THAT WAS MAINLY FOR

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:47.178
DEALING WITH THE ISSUES OF DATA-

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:48.813
THE MIGRATION AND OTHER THINGS

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.182
THAT WORDS. ALREADY IN PROCESS.

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:53.184
THIS PAST TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:55.086
BUDGET HAS BEEN ELEVEN MILLION

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:56.387
TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:59.791
THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN. IN THE

00:30:59.857 --> 00:31:01.059
BUDGET THE ACTUAL EXPENSE CHOOSE

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:02.694
ONLY BEEN TO HUNDRED IN A THAT.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.962
SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWO DOLLARS-

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:05.663
BECAUSE WE HAVE A WILL BASICALLY

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.298
POLICY PROCESS PROJECTS. ARE

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:09.334
WORKING ON THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.301
HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER AND

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:12.870
BASICALLY GOING OUT. AND DOING

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:14.572
SOLICITATION SO WE HAVE NOT

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:15.673
CONTINUE JUST EXPAND MONEY ON

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.542
THE PROJECT WITHOUT HAVING. A

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:20.878
DIRECT- INFORMATION AS TO WHO

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:22.180
WOULD BE DOING THE PROJECT IN

00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:23.581
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- YOU'VE

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:25.483
ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE OUTAGES AND

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.418
I THINK WE'VE ADVANCE OF THOSE

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:28.286
METRICS THIS MORE THIS NEEDED

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:30.655
BUT- WE HAVE WORKED. TO MAKE

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.157
SURE THAT THOSE OUTAGES DO NOT

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:35.593
AT THE ONES THAT DAY THAT UP.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.160
WHAT FOLKS HAVE MOSTLY BEEN

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:37.629
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT ONCE BEYOND

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:38.396
OUR CONTROL IT WAS NOT

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:40.698
NECESSARILY WAS IT TO DO WITH

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:42.166
CDT. AND MANY OF THEIR ISSUES

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.735
AND SO THE PROJECT WAS- WAS

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.403
DELAYED OR SIT DOWN DURING THAT

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.571
TIME FRAME BUT THAT WOULD NOT.

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:49.807
DO TO SOS AS I SAID WE HAVE A

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:50.642
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN PROJECT THAT'S

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:52.710
GOING ON WITH OUR OFFICE. WITH

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:55.680
OUR I. T. DD UP DEPARTMENT- AND

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.048
TEARS HERE THAT BASICALLY

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:59.150
ADDRESSES ALL THE ISSUES QUICKLY

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:01.619
AND- AND DEALS WITH IT VERY

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:03.121
QUICKLY. TO AVOID ANY

00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:05.223
CATASTROPHE AS I POINTED OUT WE

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.191
HAVE. A NIGHTLY WE MOVE THE DATA

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.826
TO DIFFERENT PLACES WE HAVE BEEN

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:10.094
WORKING WITH VARIOUS VENDORS IN

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:11.896
TERMS OF THE INTERNET STORAGE.

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:13.231
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO THAT

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:14.832
WE'RE NOT JUST IGNORING THE FACT

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:16.501
THAT THIS IS NOT BROKEN DOWN

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:18.603
THAT IT MIGHT IF IT DID WE COULD

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.138
RECOVER IT- AND SO OUR STAFF OUR

00:32:20.204 --> 00:32:22.373
TEAM WE HAVE A TEAM OF THOSE WHO

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.941
BASICALLY DEAL WITH THE- THE-

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:25.376
CARD CAL ACCESS TWENTY FOUR

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.312
SEVEN- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:28.746
FUNCTIONAL AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:30.448
VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF. OF

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:32.183
STORAGE AND PLACEMENT FOR A

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.185
PLATFORM FOR THAT DATA THAT'S

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:35.286
THE YEAR. SOMEWHERE WHERE THE

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:37.121
FACT THAT THE SYSTEM IS OLD AND

00:32:37.188 --> 00:32:38.489
AS A RESULT HAVE GIVEN IT

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:39.424
TREMENDOUS ATTENTION TO MAKE

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.326
SURE. THAT IT CAN SURVIVE DURING

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:42.827
THIS PROCESS WE ARE COMMITTED TO

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:44.062
MAKING SURE. THAT CAL ACCESS

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:46.164
WILL WILL SURVIVE UNTIL WE HAVE

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.300
CARS IN PLACE- WE HAVE- BECAUSE

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:51.336
THAT WE'VE RECRUITED- EXPERIENCE

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.471
STAFF TO AVOID OVER RELIANCE ON

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.773
CONTRACTED STAFF- WE NEED TO WIN

00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:02.213
WE BELIEVE WE. NEED TO LEAD AND

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.981
DIRECT THE PROJECT RATHER THAN

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:05.149
REAL HANG UP ON COUNTRY PRICE.

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.384
MANAGER THAT ARE OUT. OF S. OF

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:08.219
THE- SCHEDULE SHOULD BE REAL- WE

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:09.253
HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED AS SOME OF

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.322
YOU ASK. HOW MUCH MONEY WILL WE

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:12.957
NEED WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THAT

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.092
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HIRED THE

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:15.426
PERSONS WOULD WANT TO DO THE

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.028
WORK. WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:17.662
UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS THAT

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.130
IT'S GOING TO COST A CERTAIN

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:20.465
AMOUNT AND IT'S COVERED. THAT

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:21.466
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

00:33:21.532 --> 00:33:23.101
BECAUSE- BECAUSE IT- DEMANDS OF

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.403
THE KINDS OF THINGS. CARL YOU

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.206
KNOW THE CAL ACCESS AND CARS IS

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:29.540
A EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AS YOU

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:32.343
KNOW. OF A PROJECT THAT HAS A

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.345
LOT OF DEMANDS AND A LOT OF

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:36.047
EXPECTATIONS ON. WHAT WE WANT TO

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:37.448
HAPPEN TO ONE PERSON GOES INTO

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:39.050
THAT AND PUSH THOSE BUTTONS AND

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:40.418
THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPEN. IT

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.420
DOES SOUNDS EASY BUT IT'S REALLY

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:44.222
COMPLICATED AND AS A RESULT WE

IN TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO THUS

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:34.111
FAR HOW MANY. AND I CERTAINLY

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:36.147
GOT ON THE SYSTEM AND NOT BEEN

GASSER'S SO THERE'S AND THERE'S

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:40.618
FOR MANY HAVE THERE BEEN AS

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:41.752
OPPOSED TO THREE TWENTY TWO

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.320
THERE'S BEEN ABOUT FOUR OUTAGES

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.088
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT WE SEE

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.122
OUTAGES- THERE SOMETHING THAT WE

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:46.624
CAN'T RECOVER FROM- THAT WOULD

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.292
TAKE UP. OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:51.328
SO ABOUT FOR. INTERNALLY WE

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.130
HAVEN'T HAD TOO MANY OUTAGES ON

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:54.699
AVERAGE WE HAVE PROB FORTIFY

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:56.801
ABOUT OUTAGES- THAT COULD BE

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:58.069
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS REMOVING

00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:59.503
THE WEB SERVER IN THAT LAST LAST

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.372

THOSE HAVE INTERNALLY NOW ONLY

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.452
TALKING ABOUT WITHIN THE SYSTEM

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.053
ITSELF. HOW MANY HAVE THERE BEEN

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.422
THIS YEAR SO FAR. YES AGAIN I

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.356
THINK THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:20.725
QUESTIONS SO WHEN IS NOT

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:23.027

FOUR. OF THOSE INTERNALLY- YEAH

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:26.864
THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH INTERNAL

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:27.798
AND EXTERNAL SO IF THE SYSTEM

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:30.301
GOES NOW- FOR C. T. R. FOR THAT

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.269
OUR FIBER GOES DOWN THEN WE

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:33.037
DON'T HAVE INTERNALLY SO. IF

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:35.039
YOU'RE ASKING FOR ABOUT

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:36.507
INTERRUPTIONS- WITH- THAT COULD

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:38.175
BE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO WHAT

00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:40.444
WE DO IS FOR EXAMPLE AGAIN. I'M

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:41.846
TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING SO IN

00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:43.214
INTERRUPTION WOULD WOULD APPLY

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.015
YEAH. AND SOMETHING GREATER THAN

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:47.218
THAT SO. IF YOU. GET A SENSE OF

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:49.653
HOW. HOW BROKEN IS THE SYSTEM I

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.555
MEAN SO IF. IF IT'S RUNNING

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:52.656
GREAT THEN TELL ME IT'S RUNNING

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:54.725
GREAT AND- WE CAN ALL WELL. IT'S

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:55.926
DEFINITELY A FRANKENSTEIN LIKE

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.428
MICHAEL SAY BEFORE IT HERE

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.796
HERE'S SOME STATISTICS WOULD

00:39:58.863 --> 00:39:59.363
HAVE LESS THE LAST SEVERAL

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.732
MONTHS FOR EXAMPLE. IN JULY WE

OF IT. THAT THAT WOULD MAKE A

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:31.088

PROVIDING THE STATE THAT THAT.

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:44.935
WOULD BE REIMBURSED THOSE THOSE

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:46.870
FUNDS I ASKED THAT QUESTION

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:49.540
ALSO- HAVING SPENT MY MARRIED

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.551
THAT WAS NOT. THAT WAS NOT A

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:02.119
PART OF THE COUNTRY. THAT I'M

00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:03.587
FAMILIAR. AND I ASKED THOSE

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.254
QUESTIONS OF THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:06.390
REASONS WHY WE DECIDED TO MOVE

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:07.891
FORWARD WITH SOME OF THE DATA-

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:09.426
THE USE OF RESOURCES WITH

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:10.661
REGARDS TO. A DATA MIGRATION AND

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:12.095
WHAT HAVE YOU. OF WHAT THOSE

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:14.131
THINGS ARE NOT IN THE CONTRACT-

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:15.899
AND I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:17.668
THE CONTRACT ITSELF. WE ANSWERED

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:19.269
WITH WHAT WE WERE GOING TO GET

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.971
FROM IT WITH WITH GOOD REASON.

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:23.006
I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:25.075
THIS FIRM AND THEIR EXPERIENCE

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:26.777
IN THIS AREA- AND THEIR LACK OF

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:27.611
PERFORMANCE THAT'S THE FIRST

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.346
TIME I'VE HEARD THEIR NAME

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:31.281
PERSPECTIVE. IS THAT A

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:41.024
CALIFORNIA FIRM. HI THERE MY

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:43.427
NAME'S DANA FOR BE I AM THE- ONE

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:45.395
OF THE COUNCIL AT IT YOU KNOW IF

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:47.197
THAT HAS BEEN. SOMEWHAT INVOLVED

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:49.333
IN THE PROJECT MAYBE LONGER THAN

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:52.502
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE- AT LEAST I

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:54.304
KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.073
TIME YOU KNOW WHEN PERSPECTIVE-

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:58.141
WAS THE VENDOR. THAT WAS

00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:00.677
BUILDING THE SYSTEM. AND THEN-

00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:02.045
WHEN WE ACTUALLY PIVOTED AND

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:04.314
HAVE HAD A NEW VENDOR. COME ON

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:07.150
FOR THE SYSTEM- SO I WANNA MAKE

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:08.585
MYSELF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER SOME

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.787
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I THAT I-

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.189
THESE MY UNDERSTANDING OF SOME

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:14.024
OF THE ANSWERS. YOU KNOW I WAS

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:15.492
NOT THE PER I DIDN'T NEGOTIATE

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:16.760
THE CONTRACTS OR WASN'T INVOLVED

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.629
IN THEM BUT I DID LOOK AT THE

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:20.230
CONTRACTS QUITE A BIT BECAUSE AT

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:22.599
THE TIME. IT WAS CLEAR WE WERE

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:23.400
GOING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:25.669
THROUGHOUT THE WAY I WAS- I WAS

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:27.838
YOU KNOW ADVISING AND THAT.

00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:30.107
DIRECTING ON WHAT WE WHAT WHAT

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:33.644
REMEDIES WERE AVAILABLE TO US

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.345
AND WHAT. YOU KNOW. MOSTLY WHAT

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:36.713
REMEDIES TO HELP CONTEMPORARY

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.282
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:39.683
COULD GET A COPY OF THE CONTRACT

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.251
BUT LET ME ASK YOU A FOLLOW UP

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.020
QUESTION. WAS IT AN EVERGREEN

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:44.388
CONTRACT- THAT- THAT PROVIDED

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:46.657
SERVICES OF THE EACH YEAR A

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:48.125
MONTH AND THIS WAS RENEWED IN

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:50.127
CONTINUE TO BE RENEWED. OR WHERE

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:51.528
THERE'S DELIVERABLES THAT WERE

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:52.996
REQUIRED AS PART OF THE CONTRACT

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:55.699
OKAY. SO THE FIRST CONTRACT THAT

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:58.168
WAS WITH PERSPECTIVE AND ALL

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:00.637
JUST ALSO ADD THE CONTRACT IS

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:02.572
ACTUALLY WITH. PERSPECTIVE THE

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:04.274
COMPANY CHANGED THEIR NAME TO

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:04.908
PERSPECTIVE DURING THE PROCESS

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:06.777
OF THE SILICON REGINALD NAY I

00:49:06.843 --> 00:49:08.512
BELIEVE IT WAS ENTERPRISE

00:49:08.578 --> 00:49:13.417
SERVICES LLC. OR INCORPORATED-

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:16.119
ERR PRICE SERVICES OR ENTERPRISE

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.621
SYSTEMS. AND WE CAN GET A COPY

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.323
OF THAT CONTRACT. THAT CONTRACT

00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:21.458
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE IT

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:22.492
WAS A DELIVERABLES BASED

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:25.395
CONTRACT SO THERE WERE PHASES.

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.097
AND THERE WERE CERTAIN

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.899
DELIVERABLES THAT NEEDED TO BE.

00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:30.901
FINISHED BEFORE THEY WOULD

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:33.870
INVOICE US AND BE PAID FOR THOSE

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:36.139
DELIVERABLES. AND HE SAID THERE

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:37.274
IS ANOTHER VENDOR THAT'S BEEN

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:41.812
RETAINED WHO'S THAT. YES SO- WE

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:42.679
ENDED THE CONTRACT WITH

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:46.016
PERSPECTIVE. WHEN OF THE-

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:48.885
PROJECT WAS NOT. FINISHING TO

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:50.787
OUR SATISFACTION WHAT YEAR WAS

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:53.957
THAT. I BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS IN

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:55.892
TWENTY TWENTY. OKAY THIS IS

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:58.595
BEFORE THE ACTUAL. TWENTY ONE.

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:01.264
YES CANCELLATION OR POSTPONEMENT

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:03.066
YES WHEN TWENTY TWENTY. YOU HAD

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:07.104
A CONTRACT THAT BEGAN IN TWO

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.271
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I IMAGINE

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:09.306
I'M NOT SURE WHEN IT COULD

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.708
ACTUALLY BEGAN PROVIDE I KNOW

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.543
THAT WE- THAT THAT WE-

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:16.213
TERMINATED THE CONTRACT BEFORE

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:18.215
THE SYSTEM HAD BEEN FINISHED AND

00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:21.118
WE DID A COME TO TERMS WITH

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.986
RESPECT UP OVER WHAT THEY WOULD

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.488
BE PAID AND WHAT THEY WOULD NOT

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:28.291
BE PAID. AND I BELIEVE THAT- I

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:30.060
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT LOOKED

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:32.195

THAT COMPANY PERSPECTIVE. I

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:51.081
THINK THAT IT WAS AROUND WELL.

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:55.719
AS A- I THINK IN TOTAL. IT WAS

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:58.655
PROBABLY. A LITTLE OVER FOUR

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.490
MILLION AND I'M AND I'M OKAY

KNOW THAT THE SETTLEMENT

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.962
AGREEMENT. WAS FOR SIGNIFICANTLY

00:51:06.029 --> 00:51:08.398
LESS THAN THEY HAD WERE BILLING

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.133
FOR THE TIME THEY HAD SPENT BUT

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.402
IT WAS ABOUT THREE POINT THREE

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:15.972
MILLION. THE G. WHEN YOU CANCEL

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:16.573

DELIVERABLES IN THE CONTRACT AND

00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:08.425
A CONTEMPLATION SUITS TO

LITIGATING THE FACT THAT THEY

THAT TO. REMAIN AT LEAST TWENTY

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.237
TWENTY ONE. WAS THERE ANY

SOME CONSIDERATION TO. JUST

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:35.752
REFUSING TO PAY. FOR THE WORK

THAT WAS THAT WAS DONE. THAT THE

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.790
FOR THE HOURS THAT WERE PUT IN

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.359
ON THE PHASES WITH THE NEXT

00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:44.194
PHASES UP UNTIL THE TIME WE

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:45.929
TERMINATED THE CONTRACT. AND

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.130
THEN YOU INDICATED THERE WAS

ANOTHER VENDOR CONTRACT THAT WAS

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:50.467
ISSUED AFTER THAT WHO IS THAT TO

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:52.469
AFTER THAT THERE WAS A COMPANY

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:54.671
CALLED OSAS. THAT CAN YOU SPELL

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:58.441
THAT FOR ME- S. H. E. A. S. O.

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:01.011
S. A. A. S. YES I BELIEVE THE S.

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:04.848
A. S. PARK STANDS FOR SOFTWARE

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:07.117
AS A SERVICE- I BELIEVE IT'S A

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:09.553
LOCAL CALIFORNIA COMPANY. OKAY

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:10.754
AND SO THEY WERE RETAINED IN

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.689
TWENTY. I BELIEVE THEY WERE

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:15.759
RETAINED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.561
WHAT WAS THE ESSENCE OF THAT

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:21.598
CONTRACT. THAT CONTRACT- WAS NOT

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:23.667
A DELIVERABLES BASED CONTRACT

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:24.534
THAT WAS A TIME AND MATERIALS

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:27.704
CONTRACT. I THINK I BELIEVE THE

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.773
UNDERSTANDING THERE WAS WE WERE

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.074
STILL GOING TO TRY TO MEET THE

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:32.742
DEADLINE THE STATUTORILY

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:35.211
MANDATED DEADLINE. AND THE WAY

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:37.314
WE WERE GOING THAT WE THOUGHT WE

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.250
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT WAS UP.

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:42.953
BY BUILDING IN. A LITTLE MORE

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:44.754
SPEED AND FLEXIBILITY SO IT WAS

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:47.857
A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENTS- A

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:50.026
PROCESS CALLED AGILE THAT THEY

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:52.162
THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO.

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:57.167
FOLLOW AT THE TIME. AND- OKAY

00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.234
AND YOU SAID THAT JUST TO

00:53:58.301 --> 00:54:01.738
CLARIFY STATUTES TEST ACTUALLY.

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:04.641
MANDATED THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:07.010
THAT IT WOULD THE NINETEEN WAS

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:07.677
THE DEADLINE IN THE LEGISLATION

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:08.979
SO IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:10.380
OCCURRED THAT TO CREATE A LEGAL

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:12.515
OBLIGATION ON THE- OFFICE. WELL

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:14.184
AND AGAIN I HAVEN'T PREPARED BY

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.485
LOOKING AT ALL THE STATUTES

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.187
AGAIN BUT I BELIEVE THAT AS YOU

00:54:17.253 --> 00:54:19.522
STATED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:22.926
HEARING THAT THE- THE PROMISE

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:24.661
WAS THAT IT WOULD BE COMPLETED.

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:27.864
BY TWO A TWENTY TWENTY ONE I

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:28.498
THINK THAT THERE WAS THERE WAS

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:32.602
AT ONE POINT. THE THERE WAS SOME

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.604
LEGISLATION THAT EXTENDED THE

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.873
DATE THAT CARS WAS SUPPOSED TO

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.808
BE FINISHED AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:40.710
THE REASON FOR THAT EXTENSION.

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:43.913
WAS DUE TO THE CALIFORNIA

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.483
PRIMARY CHANGING TIME THREE AND

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:49.786

COMING INTO OFFICE ONE IN BEING

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.589
KIND WITH THIS ISSUE AND- ALL

OF SPECIAL ELECTIONS IN THE-

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.396
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THE RECALL

EVERYTHING ELSE WE'VE BEEN.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.003
LAZILY FOCUSED ON THAT BUT THIS

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.372
IS NOT BY NO MEANS TO TAKEN A

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:24.774
BACKSEAT TO MY INTEREST.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.242
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I RECENTLY

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:28.311
COME ACROSS AND I HAVE BEEN

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.312
TALKING TO OUR SECRETARY OF

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:30.513
STATE IN COLORADO BECAUSE THEY

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.148
DO A LOT OF INNOVATIVE THINGS

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:33.015
AND WE'VE- WE'VE MODELED

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.484
OURSELVES AFTER THEM IN MANY

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.185
WAYS WITH THE CAR SELECTION SO.

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.254
I'LL BE TALKING WITH HER

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:40.056
CONCERNING IT BUT TO MY SURPRISE

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:43.493
SO WHAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:44.460
RECENTLY WAS ARKANSAS. IOWA HAS

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.796
A VERY GOOD SYSTEM LIKE THIS.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.231
THAT IS ABLE TO HANDLE MULTIPLE

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:49.765
THINGS AND RUNS QUITE WELL I'M

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:50.700
SHOCKED BECAUSE I'M FROM

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:52.935
ARKANSAS. AND I ALWAYS THINK OF

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:53.936
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY BEING

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:55.638
THE MOST. FORWARD PLACE IN THE

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:58.174
WORLD VISIT SO I'VE- ACTUALLY

01:02:58.241 --> 01:02:59.809
BEGAN TO INQUIRE IN ARKANSAS AND

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:01.878
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET A CHANCE TO-

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.446
NOW THAT WE HAVE A BREAK TO

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.181
BASICALLY. TALK WITH THEM AND TO

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:06.616
VISIT ARKANSAS TO SEE. WHAT THE

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:09.018
SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE AS WELL AS

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.219
SOME OF THE OTHERS AS WE ARE

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.053
MEETING WITH. THE SECRETARIES OF

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.089
STATE ACROSS THE- THE NATION TO

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:14.157
FIND OUT WHAT OTHER. OF THE

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.858
SYSTEMS ARE WORKING WELL.

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:16.959
KNOWING THAT WERE LARGER THAN

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.895
THEY ARE AND THAT THAT MAY BE.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.230
MORE DIFFICULT TO- TO HANDLE THE

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.598
AMOUNT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.433
THE NONE THE LESS YOU DON'T WANT

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.868
TO SEE WHAT THEY'VE DONE.

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:26.669
CALORIFIC THIS AT HOME TOWN

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.304
PRIDE YEAH WELL I'M NOT SURE

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:29.472
HOME TOWN PRIDE BUT- I DIDN'T

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.073
LEAVE IN THE BEST CONDITION AND

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.442
ARKANSAS WHAT LEFT A LOT OF

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:34.510
RELATIVES THE OF THE- BUT- BUT

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:36.312
DEFINITELY OF WAS SURPRISED TO

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:38.347
LEARN THAT THERE PROPERLY. ALL

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:39.415
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS IS A

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.417
SMALL STATE. BUT NONE THE LESS

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:42.318
SO MAYBE THINGS WE CAN LEARN

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.387
FROM IT. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:46.122
KNOW GIVEN THE THOSE THAT ARE

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:47.356
WORKING ON THE PROJECT NOT I

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:49.325
HAVE TO SAY THIS AND REAL PROUD

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.294
OF THEM BECAUSE- MOST OF THEM OF

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.828
HAVE BEEN WITH THE PROJECT FOR A

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.897
WHILE NOW AND MY GOAL IS TO TRY

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:56.199
TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE WORKING ON

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:58.000
THE PROJECT. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:03:58.067 --> 01:03:59.235
CHALLENGES OFTENTIMES AT THE

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:01.037
STATE LEVEL IS THAT WE HAVE

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.071
PEOPLE MOVING IN AND OUT SO

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:03.272
QUICKLY. THAT SAYS AS YOU CAN

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:05.208
SEE FROM SOME OF THE HISTORY OF

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.210
WHAT. WAS IN THE PROJECT A LOT

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:08.177
OF THOSE FOLKS ARE GONE. YOU

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.478
KNOW- WHEN THE PROJECT DIDN'T

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.080

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:13.015

WERE OTHERS HAVE MOVED ON. I

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.386
WANT TO TRY TO KEEP THE TEAM

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:19.055
TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT PROVIDES A

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.056
CONSISTENCY. WHAT WE WANT TO DO

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:21.691
AS WELL AS THE ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:23.559
AS TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:24.794
DOING THIS PROJECT IN GETTING

MORE THAN JUST A SECRETARY. AND

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:30.766
SO- WELL I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.368
THE FACT THAT THIS TEAM IS TAKEN

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:35.238

SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN THERE

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:45.414

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:56.058
A- VERY SHORT TIME FRAME THAT WE

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:57.627

DURING THE WEEK WHAT CALL PROOF

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.208
OF CONCEPT WE HAVE TO TRY IT OUT

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:00.476
FIRST TO SEE IF IT'S GOING TO

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:02.478
WORK. SO A LOT OF THESE GUYS THE

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.180
SMART GUYS ARE NOT TALKING RIGHT

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.381
NOW OUR BEHIND THE SCENES ARE

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:06.482
LOOKING AT- VIRTUALISATION. IF

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:07.883
IT'S APPLICABLE WE'RE LOOKING

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.418
AT- YOU KNOW- MOVING THE ORACLE

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:10.653
DATABASE WHICH WHICH IS THE

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.555
BIGGEST PROBLEM WE SEEN OVER THE

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:14.490
LAST. YEAR TO NEW HARDWARE. IN

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:16.425
THE TYPOLOGIES YOU GUYS HAVE.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.360
NOW IS DIFFERENT SO WITH MOVING

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:20.596
THAT- THE DATABASE TO. TMS THE

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:21.831
TYPE OUTAGES WE HAVE BECOME

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.666
REALLY QUICKLY. BEFORE WE DAY

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:25.267
AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE WE SHOULD

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.002
RECOVER QUICKLY SO THE DS

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:27.837
ARTICLE IT'S- ORGANICALLY THE

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:30.372
SYSTEM PREPARES ITSELF. NO NO SO

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.941
WHAT I WHAT I NEED. IS THE

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:33.843
DATABASE IS STILL UP BUT OTHER

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:35.110
WEB COMPONENTS IS OUR SERVICES

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:37.112
ARE DOWN. ALL THEY NEED TO BE

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.714
DONE IS RESTARTED. BUT WHEN THE

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:41.684
DATABASE IS NOT. WORKING ARE NOT

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:42.585
FUNCTIONING. THAT IS A LONGER

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.587
PROCESS. IS SINCE WE MOVED IT TO

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:46.155
TMS THE DATABASE'S BEEN ALMOST

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.823
ARE PERCENT ROCKS. WHAT BROUGHT

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.125
SALAS SO THAT MEANS A LOT OF

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.593
OUTAGES WE HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:52.228
TYPOLOGIES. MAYBE COMPARED TO

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.696
YEARS AGO. I'M ONLY JUST

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:55.698
GUESSING THAT BECAUSE WE MOVED

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.032
IT WE SEE THAT IMPROVEMENT SO

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.200
THE TYPE ALLERGIST WE HAVE RIGHT

01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:00.035
NOW ARE SICK IT SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.705
LESS THE- INTERRUPTION TIME AS

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:03.973
PROBABLY BEFORE MAYBE TWO OR

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:05.374
THREE YEARS AGO. SO WE'RE

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:06.675
CONTINUES LOOKING AT DIFFERENT

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:08.110
WAYS WITHOUT MISS OF THE CODE

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:10.312
WITHOUT TAKING NOW. KALANK SAYS

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.147
ALSO WE JUST BRAINSTORM SO

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:13.382
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE'RE

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:15.184
LOOKING AT BUT AGAIN THIS IS OFF

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.219
OF A CONCEPT BECAUSE IS NOT

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:18.354
SUPPORTED CODES. NO ONE WANTS TO

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.356
TOUCH YOU KNOW VENDOR WANTS TO

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:21.557
TOUCH IT- SO WE HAVE TO REALLY

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.459
HAVE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.261
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT. I JUST

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:26.328
GOT MORE COURSES SO IT'S ALWAYS

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.997
WITH YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.231
THERE'S AN ALERT RIGHT ANY ANY

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:31.100
FIXED YOU SORT OF- BALLOT HOW

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:32.401
MANY THERE ARE AN AVERAGE. MONTH

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:34.203
BUT BUT THAT REQUIRES SOME LEVEL

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.371
OF HUMAN INTERVENTION ON POINTS

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:43.212
OVER TO WATCH. IS IT. TWENTY

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.346
FOUR SEVEN SUPPORT WHAT WHAT

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:47.182
LEVEL SUPPORT JIM LIKE WITH YOU

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:47.850
YOU KNOW. WE IF IT'S DURING A

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.919
WORKDAY. SOMEBODY'S THERE BUT GO

01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:50.519
ON WE CAN NIGHT YEAH BUT WHAT

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:52.254
HAPPENED- GIVEN EGGS. IF WE HAVE

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:53.489
AN- AT O'CLOCK- IN THE MORNING

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:55.224
WITH A THE SYSTEM UP WE HAVE

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:57.393
SOMEBODY SAY HEY. IT'S HAVEN'T

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:58.193
THE CHANNEL CONSUME REBOOT THE

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.261
SIR. BECAUSE IT HASN'T. WE HAVE

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.430
SOMEBODY THAT THE THAT NOW GO IN

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:02.431
EVERYBODY'S. IT IS OUR BEST

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.099
EFFORTS FOR FOUR BY. THE MON.

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:06.035
CAN GIVES US REAL TIME ACCESS TO

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:07.136
SEE WHEN THE SYSTEM IS DOWN OR

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:09.271
NOT RESPONDING. AND IN A COUPLE

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.172
OF TIMES WE HAVE TO INTERACT

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.575
WITH THAT. BUT YES WE HAVE

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:13.475
PEOPLE WHO ARE. CONSTANTLY DEAL.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.677
GETTING THESE ALERTS IN ASKING

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:17.746
OTHER MEMBERS. OF THE TEAM. TO

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.348
RESTORE SERVICE TO MAKE IT BACK

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:20.716
UP SO IT'S A VERY MANUAL PROCESS

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:22.585
IS NOT AUTOMATED. AND I. T. LIKE

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:25.154
AUTOMATION- WE TO THE LIKE THAT

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.755
BUT- WITH THE SYSTEM. ARE HIS

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:28.290
RETIRED BE ON THE BACK WE REALLY

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:30.392
CAN'T DO AUTOMATION SO IS A VERY

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:31.894
MANUAL PROCESS WE DO. THIS IS

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.162
THE BEST EFFORT AND AS WE GROW

01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:35.497
AS I. T. WE HAVE MORE REESE'S WE

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.265
WORE RESOURCE. RESOURCES COMING

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.000
ON. THAT CAN HELP FACILITATE.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.735
THESE CHANGES. SO IT'S NOT

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.136
UNLIKELY THAT THAT A MEMBER OF

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:42.504
THE PUBLIC OR- SOMEBODY AT THE

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.206
FCC AND ACCESS THE SYSTEM MIGHT

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.709
BE THE FIRST PERSON. TO DISCOVER

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:48.210
THAT THERE IS AN OUTAGE OR A

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.378
DIRECT DATA INTERRUPTIONS SO IS

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.313
THERE A FACILITY FOR. THE PUBLIC

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.182
TO ALERT. YOUR STAFF YOUR TECH

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:55.250
TEAM. THAT THAT THERE'S A

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:56.518
PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM THAT

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.987
THEY'RE NOT. I WOULD SAY THAT WE

01:10:58.053 --> 01:10:59.755
WILL PROPERTY NO FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:04.960
A PERSON I GIVE YOU. HAVE YOU

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:05.761
KNOW HYPOTHETICAL- REALISTIC. IF

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:07.596
WE'RE- ON READ. THIS I BECAUSE-

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:10.899
MIGHT TWENTY. IT IT IS

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:11.533
TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE. AND BY

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.370
THE TIME THEY REACH OUT TO US

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.738
IT'S ALREADY RES RESOLVE

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:18.207
RECOVERY IT'S- RESTORED. WE SEE

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:20.776
THE SYSTEM- IS A LOT OF. PEOPLE

01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:22.845
YOUR QUESTION WAS IT THERE'S A

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:25.014
MECHANISM FOR CONTACTING I DON'T

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.548
THINK THERE IS A TO A MECHANISM

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.617
TO CONTACT US. BUT WE ARE

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:31.353
ALERTED. ON THE SYSTEM. AND MOST

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.221
LIKELY IF IT THERE'S

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:34.657
INTERRUPTION MOST LIKELY- IS

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:35.791
BEING REBOOTED SO THERE'S A

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:37.326
CHANCE THAT CUSTOMERS LIKE HEY I

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:38.427
CANNOT GET TO THIS WEBPAGE OF

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.095
CALLIXTUS. IN IN TWO MINUTES

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.464
LATER ALL IT'S UP YOUR PROJECTS

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:43.732
ARE MOST LIKELY CHAU SURVIVES

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.467
DECISION I CAN'T GET A RESULT.

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:46.435
IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:47.403
SOMEBODY'S AWARE OF THE PROBLEM

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.905
AND CORRECT PROBLEMS BUT IT'S

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.407
NOT. GUARANTEED IT'S- IT'S NOT

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.275
YOURS OKAY YEAH. OKAY SO GETTING

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:54.576
BACK ON THE LARGER QUESTIONS

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.045
ISN'T. LOOKING FORWARD IF WE

01:11:56.111 --> 01:11:57.913
STIPULATE THAT. TWENTY FOUR

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.181
THIRTY SIX MONTHS FROM NOW YOU

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:03.185
HAVE A YOU KNOW A NEW SYSTEM IN

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:04.753
PLACE. BATTLE TESTED. WHAT CAN

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.955
WE DO IN THE- RIGHT MINUTES ON

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.123
THAT LONG INTERVAL- FOR PEOPLE

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:10.259
TO HAVE CHALLENGES ACCESSING. IT

01:12:10.325 --> 01:12:11.393
WHICH SHOULD BE VERY TRANSPARENT

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.695
INFORMATION YEAH SO AGAIN YOU'RE

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:14.163
A YEAR I THINK THAT THE THING

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.465
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FIRST OF

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:17.232
ALL BECAUSE SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:18.267
RELIABILITY ON IT IF SOMETHING

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:20.703
GOES DOWN. AGAIN TRYING TO TEST

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:21.770
OUT- SOME OF THE- PROOF OF

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:23.138
CONCEPT WE HAVE WAS YOU KNOW

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:24.873
BREAK UPS DIFFERENT SERVICES-

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.076
INTO THEIR OWN ENTITIES- BUT I

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:30.045
MEAN BY THAT IS JUST KIND OF

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.780
LOOKING OUT OF CODY IS. IT SEE

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:32.347
WHAT WE CAN DO AS FAR AS

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:33.482
RESOURCES. THAT'S OUR BIGGEST

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.784
THING RIGHT NOW SO AGAIN WE HAVE

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.152
TO TRY OUT- WE HAVE A COUPLE

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.721
THINGS HE'LL WITH THAT WE WERE

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.289
TRYING TO FUTURE. TO SEE IF WE

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:42.224
CAN ENHANCE IT- THE STABILITY IT

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.325
OUT. YOU KNOW FOR US IS THE

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:45.127
RECOVERY TIME IS THAT WHERE

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.628
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ALLERGIST I

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.697
MEAN THIS IS THE SYSTEM IT IS.

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:50.432
BUT WE TRY TO DO IS HAVE AS

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:51.066
MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE- THE MOST

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:53.102
SIGNIFICANT ONE I KEEP GOING

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:54.703
BACK TO THE BECAUSE HE'S A WAS

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.205
THAT WE REALLY HAVE NO CONTROL

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.506
OVER AT THIS POINT. IS REALLY

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:59.108
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A SECOND

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:00.776
PASSED- TO THE DATABASE IF THAT

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.144
PATH GOES DOWN I BELIEVE THAT

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:04.480
THE NUMBER OF OUTAGES AS FAR AS

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:05.481
HOW LONGER OUT. WILL BE

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.049
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SO WE GET

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.283
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO- MAY NOT

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.085
CALL IN BECAUSE THE SYSTEM HAS

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.186
BEEN DOWN FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.222
HOURS. THAT'S JUST MY OPINION MY

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:18.160
OBSERVATION. NO PROJECT THANK.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.295
THANK YOU. FOR RIFIC THANK YOU-

TAKING TIME JUST. WITH US. AND

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.333
AT ALL THAT'S THE LEADERSHIP.

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:25.300
AND FRUSTRATIONS THAT COME WITH

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:27.503
THE JOB THAT YOU HAVE. BEEN

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:27.936
APPOINTED TO. QUITE

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.671
APPROPRIATELY- WE'RE GOING TO

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.140
CONTINUE TO MAKE IT ONE THING I

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:33.108
JUST WANT. TO SAY THANK YOU FOR

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.077
YOUR HONESTY RIGHT FOR YOUR

CANDOR IN THIS I MEAN THAT IS.

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:37.579
REFRESHING WHEN IT COMES TO

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:38.413
THESE THINGS ASSEMBLY ACTUALLY.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.015
SET UP YOUR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.650
DO YOU KNOW IT MEANT WHAT NEEDS

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:43.018
FIXING AND- AND POSTED PICTURES

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.419
OF HIGH PRESSURE BALBOA MAMA

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:46.288
SAID IF YOU TELL A LIE YOU HAVE

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:48.724
TO PUT LEGS ON A TO MAKE A STAND

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.592
UP SO IT'S A CONSTANT JOB TO

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.127
KEEP ALIVE LIVE. A DETAILED- SO

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:53.095
THAT'S WAS SAYING OVER AND OVER.

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:58.320
MAP WHICH YOU'VE IDENTIFIED.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.155
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT ROAD MAP

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.291
THAT HAS YOU. AS YOU'RE AT YEARS

OURS AS WELL THAT THAT'S WHERE

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.029
IF WE COULD MAYBE JUMP OFF TO

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:08.463

INVITING. US TO TESTIFY TODAY-

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.106
YOU KNOW I THINK IT WOULD BE. IN

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.374
TO COVER A LITTLE BIT OF THE

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.076
PROJECT HISTORY AND WE'VE TALKED

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.010
ABOUT PERSPECTIVE WE TALKED

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:23.445
ABOUT- SASS- JUST TO GIVE A

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:25.213
LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE ABOUT

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.281
THE PROJECT ASSESSMENT. I THINK

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:28.016
IT INFORMS WHAT LESSONS WE CAN

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.185
LEARN- AND WHAT THE PATH FORWARD

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.354
IS FOR THIS PROJECT- ONE THING

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.122
THAT WAS MENTIONED IS YOU KNOW

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.357
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FLAWS

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.892
WITH THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:38.193
OF THIS PROJECT SOME OF WHICH

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.194
HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BUT I JUST

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.163
WANT TO RUN THROUGH THEM BECAUSE

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:42.097
I THINK IT'S INSTRUCTIVE FOR THE

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.999
NEXT. STEPS ON THIS PROJECT- ONE

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:46.068
OF THEM WAS FLAWED TESTING

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:46.635
ACTIVITIES SOME OF THE STAFF

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:47.903
DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.237
WERE TESTING OR WERE NOT

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:51.239
PREPARED TO TEST THAT SYSTEM

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.908
THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED- THERE

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.142
WAS A RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.244
INVALID RISKS. TO THE PROJECT'S

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:57.479
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT WERE

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.681
ACTUALLY RAISED BY INTERNAL

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:01.550
STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN SOS. AND

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:02.951
THEN SYSTEM COMPONENTS THAT WERE

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:04.653
BEING DEVELOPED WERE SO TIGHTLY

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.555
COUPLED WITH THE BUSINESS RULES.

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:08.323
THAT ARE REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.591
RUN THE SYSTEM THAT WHEN YOU

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.526
NEEDED TO MAKE A CHANGE IN

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:12.561
BUSINESS RULES. IT WOULD

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:13.195
ACTUALLY REQUIRE CHANGES ACROSS

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:14.730
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND SO THERE

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.198
WAS NO SEPARATE BUSINESS RULES

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:17.466
ENGINE THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:20.869
UPDATED BASED ON LEGISLATION OR

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.738
OTHER CHANGES. THAT WERE MADE- I

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.706
THINK THE PATH FORWARD HAS

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:25.707
ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED THERE IS

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:26.942
A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:27.876
BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.678
TECHNOLOGY. AND THE SECRETARY OF

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:31.513

STAGE ONE DOCUMENTATION WHICH IS

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.221
THE BUSINESS ANALYSIS WHICH

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:40.789
PROVIDES THE BUSINESS GOALS FOR

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:41.957
THE PROJECT. HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:43.825
APPROVED. AND NOW THE PROJECT IS

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:45.160
WORKING ON A STAGE TO

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:46.495
DOCUMENTATION AND THAT WILL GIVE

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:47.963
US THE- PRELIMINARY BASELINE

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.865
COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE FOR THE

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.933
PROJECT GOING FORWARD- THE

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.368
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE IS

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:54.803
EXPECTING THAT TO BE AVAILABLE

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:56.304
SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:57.506
ALONG WITH WHATEVER BUDGET

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:59.408
REQUEST IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:02.611
TO GO INTO TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:05.013
TWENTY FOUR- I THINK. ONE OF THE

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.749
LESSONS LEARNED THAT. IT IS

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:09.251
EVIDENT FROM READING THE PROJECT

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:10.152
ASSESSMENT AND LOOKING AT THE

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:12.854
PROJECT ROAD MAP. IS THAT AS THE

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:13.422
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:15.357
MENTIONED. WORKING WITH THE

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:17.259
SYSTEM INTEGRATOR VENDOR. IS

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:19.928
VERY IMPORTANT. BUT THE ULTIMATE

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:21.463
AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.264
RESTS WITH THE SECRETARY OF

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.932
STATE'S OFFICE. THAT THEY NEED

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:25.667
TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:27.869
THEY NEED TO BE WORKING

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:28.503
ALONGSIDE THE VENDOR. BUT THEY

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:31.239
ULTIMATELY NEED TO BE. INVOLVED

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.441
IN MAKING SURE THEY'RE ASSESSING

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:34.376
RISK AND MITIGATING THOSE RISKS

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.345
AS THE PROJECT CONTINUES- WE'VE

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:38.613
ALSO SEEN FROM THE PROJECT

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.048

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:42.350
PART OF THE PROJECT ASSESSMENT-

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.853
INITIAL PROJECT COST- THAT THEY

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.721
ESTIMATE- WOULD WOULD BE

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:48.090
REASONABLE FOR THIS PROJECT IN.

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:49.357
THE RANGE OF FIFTY MILLION

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.226
DOLLARS- AND- DO YOU KNOW

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:52.661

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:08.003
COSTS OF THE- QUADRUPLED OR

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:09.804
GREATER. WHAT WHAT WHAT. WHAT

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:10.972
SHOULD WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THAT

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:12.240
I MEAN SHOULD WE TO THE

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:13.408
LEGISLATURE BE MORE ATTENTIVE TO

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.343
THOSE CONTRACTS WHEN THEY'RE-

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.512
WHEN THEY'RE ISSUED- SHOULD WE

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:19.114
HAVE REVIEWS OF THOSE CONTRACTS

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.216
OF. OF SUCH SIGNIFICANCE. SO WE

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:22.784
JUST DON'T LET THEM RUN ITS

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.119
COURSE AND THEN FIND OUT YEARS

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:25.954
LATER THAT. MISTAKES WERE MADE.

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.355
IS THERE ANY LESSONS THERE. YEAH

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:29.224
I THINK THE LESSON LEARNED FROM

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.959
THE INITIAL CONTRACT WAS THAT.

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:32.093
PERSPECTIVE WAS TRYING TO

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.429
IMPLEMENT A COMMERCIAL OFF THE

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.831
SHELF SOLUTION. FOR SOMETHING

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:37.666
THAT HAS REALLY COMPLEX

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.234
REQUIREMENTS AND SO WHEN YOU'RE

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:40.735
TRYING TO JUST TAKE SOFTWARE

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:42.070
YOU'VE DEVELOPED AND PUT IT IN

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:43.638
AND ASSUME THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:20:43.705 --> 01:20:45.407
WORK PROPERLY FOR SOMETHING AS

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:46.608
COMPLEX. AS DISCLOSURE CAMPAIGN

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.176
DISCLOSURE AND YOU KNOW LOVING

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:50.178
STATEMENTS. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:51.913
GOING TO WORK IF YOU DON'T

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:52.781
REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:54.282
MUCH CUSTOMISATION NEEDS TO BE

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:56.318
DONE. AND SO I THINK THAT OVER

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:57.452
THE YEARS THE FOUR YEARS THAT

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.421
PERSPECTIVE WAS THE VENDOR. THAT

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:00.555
REALLY WASN'T UNDERSTOOD UNTIL

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.457
THE END WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE TO

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:05.060
ACTUALLY ADDRESS- AND WITH- SAYS

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.661
IT WAS JUST SUCH A CONDENSED

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.196
TIMELINE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:09.431
EIGHT MONTHS TO A YEAR TO

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:10.699
IMPLEMENT SOMETHING THAT. OVER

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:11.666
FOUR YEARS CONNECT EVEN BE

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.201
IMPLEMENTED. AND SO THERE WAS

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.402
JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME AND THEY

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:16.238
REALLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND ALL

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.339
THOSE COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS UP

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:19.140
FRONT. SO THE UNDER BID AND OVER

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:21.343
PROMISED. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:26.615
FORWARD ABOUT KIND OF THE.

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:28.250
FORTIN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:30.118
PROCUREMENT WAS DONE. RIGHT

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.820
MAKING SURE THAT THE PROCUREMENT

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.455
WAS DONE COMPETITIVELY THAT

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.422
THERE WERE MULTIPLE BETTER IS

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.057
THAT THERE WAS. YOU KNOW IN IN

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:37.926
SOME CASES PROOFS OF CONCEPT AS

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:39.227
PART OF THE PROCUREMENT SO YOU

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:41.363
CAN TEST WHETHER THERE ARE THE

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:42.964
CREEK SCENARIOS THAT ARE GOING

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:45.567
TO BE. ADDRESSED BY THE SOLUTION

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.836
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROCURE-

01:21:47.902 --> 01:21:48.737
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:49.971
BEING DONE MORE ROUTINELY WITH

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:52.274
TODAY'S IT PROJECTS AS OPPOSED

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.642
TO FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.343
CERTAINLY I THINK. WATCHING THE

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.711
PROCUREMENT MAKING SURE YOU

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.280
UNDERSTAND KIND OF WHAT VENDORS

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.848
ARE PARTICIPATING AND ASKING FOR

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:01.249
INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:02.183
CONTRACTS WHETHER THEY'RE FIXED

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:05.086
YOU KNOW- PRICE. CONTRACTS WITH

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:07.289
DELIVERABLES AND KIND OF NEGATED

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.390
REVIEWS THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:11.559
THINGS TO ASK- AS YOU GO THROUGH

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:12.661
EVEN THE BUDGET PROCESS YOU'RE

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.529
LOOKING AT KIND OF THE NEXT.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:15.597
YEAR'S APPROPRIATIONS RIGHT

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:18.700
OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR MANY

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:22.337
QUESTIONS. YEAH GOOD KIND OF

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:23.638
COMES BACK TO A QUESTION I ASKED

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:25.440
OF THE OF THE SECTOR. WHO YOU

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:27.442
KNOW WHAT IT WE LEARNED. HOW TO

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:28.376
GET THROUGH. TO YOU KNOW THAT

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:30.545
THAT END DATE. FOR THE NEXT

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:31.780
IMPLEMENTATION. AND PRIME MORE

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:33.515
POORLY OUT OF HOW DO WE PREVENT

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:34.582
THIS IMAGE IMMIGRATION RICHARD

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:35.650
QUESTION THAT CONTRACTS BUT MORE

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.652
AND MORE GENERALLY. FROM YOUR

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:39.054
PERSPECTIVE IT NGUYEN WHAT

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.655
WHAT'S THE BIG LESSON HERE THAT

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.724
WE AS- LEGISLATORS MIGHT APPLY

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:46.394
EITHER LEGISLATIVELY OR THROUGH

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.229
OVERSIGHT. I THINK ONE OF BIG

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:50.999
LESSONS IS THAT. USING THE

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:52.934
STATE'S IT PROJECT APPROVAL

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:55.003
PROCESS SEES IS IMPORTANT. I

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:57.639
THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS THAT

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:58.840
THERE WAS AN EXEMPTION IN THE

01:22:58.907 --> 01:22:59.974
BILL. THAT WAS INTENDED TO

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:00.909
EXPEDITE THE DEVELOPMENT

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:02.911
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM. I

01:23:02.977 --> 01:23:04.446
THINK THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:05.714
CYCLE THAT THE PROJECT IS GOING

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.916
THROUGH NOW IS A ROBUST PROCESS

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:10.251
INVOLVES MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS-

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:10.719
THE LEGISLATURE GETS

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:13.088
DOCUMENTATION AT EVERY STAGE OF

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.823
THE PROCESS SO WE CAN REVIEW

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.324
THOSE. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.226
IS BEING ASSUMED. YOU KNOW WHAT

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:20.462
PROCUREMENT IS BEING USED WHAT

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:21.463
ARE THE REQUIREMENTS WHAT ARE

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:22.697
THE OBJECTIVES IT'S ALL THERE IN

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:24.399
WRITING AND IT CAN BE REVIEWED.

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.901
I THINK THE EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:29.337
OF A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:31.172
WHAT'S GOING ON AS THE PROJECTS

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:32.640
BEING PLANNED- I THINK LESSONS

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:33.975
LEARNED IT'S REALLY

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:35.844
UNDERSTANDING THOSE COMPLEX

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:38.213
BUSINESS. REQUIREMENTS AND

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:39.981
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS UP FRONT.

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:41.649
AND MAKING SURE THAT THE VENDORS

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:43.451
ARE AWARE OF THAT AND BEING

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:45.053
HONEST ABOUT ANY OF THE

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.422
POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS. THAT COULD

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:48.590
BE FACED AS THEY DEVELOP THE

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:50.158
SYSTEM I THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:51.993
OPTIMISM OFTENTIMES WITH VENDORS

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.795
THAT THEY CAN GET THINGS DONE.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:57.465
ON SCHEDULE AND WITHIN BUDGET- I

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:58.166
THINK HAVING A CLEAR

01:23:58.233 --> 01:23:59.734
UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT THE

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:01.503
CONTINGENCY REALLY WHAT OUR

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:03.571
CONTINGENCY PLANS WHAT IS A ROLL

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:04.506
BACK PLAN IT JUST DOESN'T GO

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:06.641
ACCORDING TO PLAN- YOU KNOW AND

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.276
WHAT WHAT KIND OF COST OVER RUNS

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:10.445
UP CAN BE A DISSIPATE. I THINK

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:11.846
THOSE ARE ALL OF THE LESSONS

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.748
LEARNED FROM THIS LAST ITERATION

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:15.016
AND MY LAST QUESTION SO DID YOU

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:19.554
FEEL LIKE. MISS MR THAT THAT AT

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:20.889
THIS POINT. EIGHT YOU KNOW GET

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:23.458
TO MY QUESTION OR- BUT MORE CHEN

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:25.560
THAT THE YOU HAVE. ANOTHER THIS

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:26.861
. INTO THIS PER. IS VICIOUS

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:29.831
RELAY TO RESP- IN PROGRESS AT

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.866
THIS POINT THAT YOU'D FEEL

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:32.634
COMFORTABLE AT THIS POINT I

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.068
WOULD SAY THAT THE SECRETARY OF

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:35.770
STATE'S OFFICE HAS BEEN VERY

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:37.272
HELPFUL IN HELPING US UNDERSTAND

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:38.706
WHERE THEY ARE WITH THE PROJECT

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:40.008
CURRENTLY YOU'VE MET WITH THEM

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.242
SEVERAL TIMES- I WOULD ALSO SAY

01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:42.844
THAT WE HAVE. DISCUSSIONS WITH

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.612
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ABOUT

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.114
KIND OF THEIR ROLE IN THIS

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.415
PROCESS AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.483
KIND OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.552
OFFER AS A PLAN THIS PROJECT-

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:51.886
HAS BEEN HELPFUL. I THINK IT'S

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:53.221
VERY EARLY ON IN THE PLANNING

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:55.290
STAGES TO BE HONEST- WE'RE ONLY

01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:57.258
IN STAGE ONE WE HAVE THE

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:58.660
BUSINESS SCHOOLS A LOT OF THE

01:24:58.726 --> 01:24:59.461
STUFF THAT'S REUSABLE HAS BEEN

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:01.262
PUT INTO THAT. WE NEED TO REALLY

01:25:01.329 --> 01:25:02.464

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:04.199
SCHEDULE AND SCOPE. AND THAT'S

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:05.300
PART OF THAT STAGE YOU

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:07.569

OF GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF KIND

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:11.439
OF WHAT SOLUTIONS WERE

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:12.807
CONSIDERED. AND REALLY HAVE A

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:14.776

OPTIONS WERE CONSIDERED. AND I

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.713

OTHER JURISDICTIONS LIKE TRONIC

01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:02.984

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:18.299
FIRST WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:19.767
CREATION OF A MORE INTUITIVE

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:21.202

BURDEN OF COMPLIANCE FOR FILERS.

01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:25.473
AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS THE

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.108
FACT THAT THE SYSTEM WILL BE

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:28.977
DATA DRIVEN. I WHICH WE

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:29.577
UNDERSTAND TO MEAN TRANSACTION

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:31.179

INDEPENDENT OF ANY PARTICULAR

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:45.627
FORM. ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.794
THIS IS THAT THE FARTHER WOULD

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:48.863
ONLY NEED TO INPUT A PARTICULAR

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.131

REPORTING PERIOD THE SYSTEM

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:05.380

01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:22.122
PLACE AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:23.657
ENHANCE IT VERSES REPEAT IT.

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:25.759

01:39:34.568 --> 01:39:35.736
GIVE SOME CONTEXT TO MY

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:37.471
PARTICIPATION IN ADDITION TO MY

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:40.174
WORK WITH EPA. I'VE BEEN PART OF

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.275
WHAT WAS CALLED THE STAKEHOLDER

01:39:41.342 --> 01:39:42.843
INPUT GROUP WHICH IS THE

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.545
INDUSTRY FOLKS WHO PARTICIPATED

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:46.714
WITH ASAL LAST IN THE VARIOUS

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:47.848
CONTRACTORS TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK.

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:49.483
I WAS ALSO A BETA TESTER OF THE

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:51.385
SYSTEM ONE OF THE THIRD PARTY

01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:52.753
PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY GOT TO GO

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.855
IN AND- KEEP THE WHEELS A LITTLE

01:39:54.922 --> 01:39:55.923
BIT SO- MY COMMENTS AND-

01:39:55.989 --> 01:39:57.591
SCRATCHED OUT THE ONES PEOPLE OF

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.160
ART HE SAID AND I FOCUS THEM ON-

01:40:00.227 --> 01:40:02.029
WHAT WE HOPE TO SEE IN THE NEW

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:03.297
SYSTEM WHICH IS INFORMED BY SOME

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:05.299
OF THE CHALLENGES WE SAW WITH

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:08.302
THE PRIOR ITERATION OF CARS- THE

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:09.970
FIRST COMING TO MAKE- IS THAT

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:12.272
CPA HOPES TO SEE. THE SYSTEM

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:14.475
RECOGNIZE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:16.710
OF USERS ARE NOT ONE OFF

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:18.278
CAMPAIGNS ENTERING THEIR OWN

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.680
DATA REAL TIME IN THE STATE

01:40:19.747 --> 01:40:22.950
SYSTEM TO PREPARE FILINGS BY- I

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:24.284
THINK. THAT FILE THE VENDOR THAT

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:25.352
WAS MENTIONED HAS DONE AN

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:28.055
ANALYSIS AND IT'S UP WORDS 85%

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:30.824
OR MORE. OF THE SYSTEM USERS USE

01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:32.760
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE MOST OF

01:40:32.826 --> 01:40:36.730
THEM USE- EITHER CPA CPA- TYPE

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:42.503
VENDORS. AND I MENTION THAT

01:40:42.569 --> 01:40:43.337
BECAUSE- THE FIRST OF THE SYSTEM

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:45.205
WAS A VERY. ABOUT WITH A MY-

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:46.507
THAT. THE INDIVIDUAL TREASURES

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:47.307
TRACTOR COUNTRY. IN THE STATE

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:49.276
SYSTEM AND THEN HIT SUBMIT THE

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:50.411
REPORTS AND- AS A PRACTICAL

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:52.346
MATTER MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:54.148
TO BE PUTTING DATA INTO THE

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:56.717
SYSTEM UNTIL ITS FILING TIME. SO

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:58.118
THAT JUST PIGGY BACKS ON STACY'S

01:40:58.185 --> 01:41:00.154
COMMENTS ABOUT REALLY HAVING A

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.555
SYSTEM THAT WORKS WITH THOSE

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:03.924
THIRD PARTY VENDORS. SO THAT WE

01:41:03.991 --> 01:41:06.360
CAN SUBMIT DATA WHEN IT'S TIME-

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:07.594
THERE WERE SOME ISSUES WITH THE

01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:10.364
PRIOR VERSION WHERE- THERE WAS A

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:12.366
NOTION THE DATA WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:41:12.433 --> 01:41:13.500
SUBMITTED BEFORE WE COULD EVEN

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:15.502
SEE WHAT OUR FINDINGS WOULD LOOK

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:16.904
LIKE- WHICH CAUSE GREAT CONCERN

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:18.539
TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:19.139
RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:21.408
EVERYTHING'S ACCURATE- AND THE

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:22.843
SOFTWARE VENDORS CAN PROVIDE

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.144
MORE DETAIL ON THAT IN THE INPUT

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:25.779
PROCESS BUT- JUST FLAGGING

01:41:25.846 --> 01:41:28.682
ACCESS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:30.784
FROM KIND OF A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:31.552
- OUR SECOND HIGH POINT.

01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:32.486
RELEASED A SIGNATURE

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:34.955
VERIFICATION THE PRIOR VERSION

01:41:35.022 --> 01:41:36.490
WAS KIND OF BILL TAUGHT WITH THE

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:37.558
ASSUMPTION THAT EVERYONE WHO

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:39.226
SIGNS A REPORT IT'S GOING TO GO

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:40.828
THROUGH A MULTI FACTOR.

01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:42.563
AUTHENTICATION PROCESS WHICH

01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:43.730
MEANS THE GOVERNOR WOULD HAVE TO

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:45.666
DO THAT TO SIGN HIS CAMPAIGN

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:47.401
REPORTS SOMEONE RUNNING FOR CITY

01:41:47.468 --> 01:41:49.336
COUNCIL AS WELL AS A RESPONSE OR

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:51.238
OF A COMMITTEE- AND SO JUST

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:52.773
MAKING SURE THAT AGAIN IN

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.708
RECOGNITION OF OUR VENDOR

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:56.343
INDUSTRY THAT WERE AUTHORIZING

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:57.711
VENDORS TO THAT THEN WE CAN DO

01:41:57.778 --> 01:41:59.213
WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR THE

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:01.348
FILERS AND THEY CAN. WORRY ABOUT

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:03.116
THEIR CAMPAIGN. AND A COUPLE

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:06.320
OTHER AND COMMENTS I WANTED TO.

01:42:06.386 --> 01:42:08.288
HIGHLIGHT AND SO IT'S ALREADY

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:09.990
BEEN MENTIONED THE VENDORS BUT

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:11.391
ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAW WAS THE

01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:12.426
VENDORS IN THE PRIOR SYSTEM

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:13.494
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.561
CALIFORNIA REPORTING

01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:16.430
REQUIREMENTS AND SO. THE

01:42:16.497 --> 01:42:17.831
REGULATED COMMUNITY WOULD SAY

01:42:17.898 --> 01:42:19.299
WELL WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:20.767
ACTS BECAUSE THE STATUTE

01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:23.604
REQUIRES US TO DO ACTS- AND THAT

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:24.438
FEEDBACK WASN'T REALLY BEING

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:25.806
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND

01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:27.574
DEVELOPMENT. SO WHETHER THE

01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:29.176
PRIMARY VENDOR HAS CALIFORNIA

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:30.544
EXPERIENCE OR THEY'RE BROUGHT IN

01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:32.613
AS A CONSULTANT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:34.281
VALUABLE EXPERIENCE THAT EXISTS

01:42:34.348 --> 01:42:35.883
IN CALIFORNIA THAT. CAN BE

01:42:35.949 --> 01:42:38.886
TAPPED AS A RESOURCE- IN TERMS

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:41.688
OF TESTING- REGULAR USERS LIKE

01:42:41.755 --> 01:42:43.824
MYSELF AND OTHERS WERE ABLE TO

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:45.125
TEST EARLY ON AND PROVIDE

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:46.527
FEEDBACK AND I THINK THAT WAS

01:42:46.593 --> 01:42:47.728
VALUABLE TO HELPING THE

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:48.729
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

01:42:48.795 --> 01:42:50.197
REALIZED THAT WE WERE NOT READY

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:52.399
FOR GO LIVE. AND I WOULD

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:54.001
ENCOURAGE THAT PROCESS TO

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.102
CONTINUE. EARLIER RATHER THAN

01:42:55.168 --> 01:42:56.637
LATER SENSE WHERE THE FOLKS ARE

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:58.438
GOING TO IDENTIFY A LOT OF THE

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:01.375
NUANCES THAT CAN BE FIXED-

01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:04.511
SPEAKING OF FEEDBACK- ONE OF THE

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:06.513
CHALLENGES IN THE LAST ITERATION

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.982
WITH THE THIRD PARTY PROJECT

01:43:09.049 --> 01:43:11.418
MANAGER WAS. WE WOULD PROVIDE

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:12.686
FEEDBACK IN THE NEVER HEAR ABOUT

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:15.088
IT AGAIN- AND A LOT OF THAT

01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:16.356
FEEDBACK WAS NOT TAKEN SO I

01:43:16.423 --> 01:43:18.058
WOULD ENCOURAGE KIND OF AS WE'RE

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:19.326
THINKING ABOUT THE PROCESS TO

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:21.428
HAVE A SYSTEM. TO TRACK THAT

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:22.829
FEEDBACK AND ACTUALLY CIRCLE

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:25.032
BACK TO IT I KNOW AS WELL AS THE

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:26.433
STAFF TRIED TO IMPLEMENT THAT AT

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.336
THE END WITH- STAFF BUT IT WAS-

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:31.238
KIND OF TOO LATE FOR THEM TO BE

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:33.774
ABLE TO DO THAT- AND THEN ONE

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.408
OTHER ITEM THAT HASN'T BEEN

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:35.776
RAISED BUT I THINK IT'S AN

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:36.710
IMPORTANT ONE. IS THE CURRENT

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:39.079
SYSTEM I THINK THE WAY THAT-

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:40.113
CARS ONE PLANO WAS BEING

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:41.682
DEVELOPED SO REQUIRED A LOT OF

01:43:41.748 --> 01:43:43.917
HUMAN INTERVENTION. BY SECRETARY

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:46.553
OF STATE STAFF. AND I'LL GIVE A

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.655
PRACTICAL EXAMPLE- LOBBY

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:50.324
REGISTRATION RENEWALS WERE DUE

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:52.092
IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY.

01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:54.728
AND DATA RELATED TO THOSE

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:57.164
REGISTRATIONS- AS LATE AS LAST

01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:58.632
MONTH STILL HADN'T BEEN MANUALLY

01:43:58.699 --> 01:44:03.103
ENTERED BY THE TEAM THAT ALSO

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:05.072
LOST ON CARRACKS **** SO. IF THE

01:44:05.138 --> 01:44:05.973
FILE CHANGE THROUGHOUT FOR. THE

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.374
OLD I'D WAS STILL ON THERE AND

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:09.176
THAT'S BY NO MEANS A REFLECTION

01:44:09.242 --> 01:44:11.244
ON THE STAFF THEY ARE. HAVE SO

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:13.246
MUCH WORK AND THEY WORK VERY

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:14.381
HARD BUT- WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:15.315
UPDATE OUR REGISTRATION

01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:16.717
INFORMATION AND HAVE THE SYSTEM

LIKE TO SEE IN THE SYSTEM. THE

01:47:58.738 --> 01:48:01.241
ALL A MATTER OF LAW WILL HAVE TO

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:03.109
