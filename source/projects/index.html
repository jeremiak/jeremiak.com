    <h3>BestNest</h3>
    <p>An app focused on Chattanooga, TN which consumes newly-published datasets about residential buildings in the city to help low-income renters learn more about the properties they are interested in renting. The Best Nest client and API were both written in JavaScript and utilized MongoDB as the datastore.</p>

    <h3>Civic Quarterly</h3>
    <p>Civic Quarterly is a journal of thoughtful analysis, constructive critique and original writing on government, technology and society.</p>
    <p>The first issue of Civic Quarterly was created by a group of 2014 Code for America fellows inspired by our year-long engagement with cities and governments across the United States. While each team faced unique challenges and environments in their cities, many themes were similar. We told each other stories of success and failure that resonated beyond our individual experiences. Those conversations led us to create a publication directed squarely at open government practitioners.</p>

    <h3>City of Chattanooga Open Data Policy</h3>
    <p>We worked with members of the Mayor's staff and the community to draft an <a href="https://github.com/cityofchattanooga/Chattanooga-Open-Data-Policy" target="_blank">an open data policy on GitHub</a>. The executive order was signed by Mayor Andy Berke on May 31, 2014, and directs the city government to take inventory of its valuable data and subsequently open it to the public.</p>
    <p>All the data is published to the <a href="https://data.chattlibrary.org/" target="_blank">open data portal hosted by the Public Library</a>. This mean developers can use government data, such as code violations or recreational center locations for example, to build applications for the community. It also means that developers can work more closely with the city to tackle government service challenges.</p>

    <h3>Chattanooga Fellowship Team Mid-year Report</h3>
    <p>Half-way through the year-long fellowship engagement, our team produced a report for our various stakeholders: the City, our funders, and Code for America. We decided to tell the story of our work through a hypothetical developer in Chattanooga, and used the scroll depth as a timeline so as the user scrolled through the page, different scenes animated in and out to showcase the various projects we were undertaking.</p>

    <h3>Civic User Testing Group in Chattanooga</h3>
    <p>The Chattanooga Civic User Testing (CUT) Group is a set of regular Chattanoogans who get paid to test out civic apps.</p>

    <p>A Code for San Francisco web-based tool for a small team to collect the geolocation of all trash cans in San Francisco because the dataset was needed for analysis but unattainable from the City. The app is separated into a Github-hosted front-end and a Python API deployed to Heroku.</p>
