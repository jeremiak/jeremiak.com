      </div>
      <p>As a fellow with Code for America, I partnered with the City of Chattanooga to open and promote municipal data, prototype web applications built on top of that data, and explore ways to leverage technology and the community to improve the lives of city residents.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built Best Nest, an app that consumed newly-published datasets about residential buildings in the city to help low-income renters learn more about the properties they were interested in renting. The Best Nest client and API were both written in JavaScript and utilized MongoDB as the datastore.</li>
        <li>Drafted Chattanooga’s first open data policy and advocated for the value of publishing the data in open and accessible formats, resulting in the publishing of a few dozen datasets and an inaugural open data inventory cataloging over 550 data sets within the city.</li>
        <li>Conducted community outreach and organizing to create the Chattanooga Civic User Testing group that provides local app developers the opportunity to engage with fellow residents and receive first-hand feedback about their app design and function. Secured a grant from the local Benwood Foundation to ensure that the testers would be financially compensated for their time and input.</li>
