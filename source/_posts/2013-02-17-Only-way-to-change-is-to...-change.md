I found myself continually visiting The Huffington Post many times a day,
despite what I consider to be almost sheer sensationalist journalism.

And I just found myself doing it again, one too many times. I've been thinking
a bit recently about how to design behavior, particularly bad or unwanted
behavior and I've come to the conclusion that it must be built into the
constraints we apply to ourselves or users.

Thus, the following now resides in my /etc/hosts file:
