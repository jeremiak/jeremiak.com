`Cache-Control` is Key

[Context switching as easy as cd](https://github.com/jeremiak/context-
switcher):

Of course, there is no way that context switching can be as easy as issuing
one of the most basic shell commands. But perhaps it can get closer?

I made a dumb error today when I was going between directories of different
projects and ended up breaking our chat bot. I thought “wouldn’t it be nice to
be able to leave yourself little sticky notes on your directories?”

I quickly whipped up context-switcher and I’m going to be testing it out for
the next few weeks to see if I utilize it and if it helps, hinders or provides
no value at all.

> **context-switcher** \- Overloads the cd() function to check for a .welcome
or a README.md and outputs that to the shell

If you give it a whirl, let me know what you think.
