Since I’m on a Facebook tear right now, along with the rest of the world I
suppose, it would be prudent to lay down some of my thoughts regarding the
newest it-thing in the Facebook ecosystem: Zynga.

The game company’s recently filed S-1 reveals how important the social graph
(and the largest creator of it) is to Zynga. The S-1 filing mentioned Facebook
over **200** times (source). This may not be surprising to those who
understand Zynga to be the creator of _FarmVille_ and _MafiaWars_ (two very
popular Facebook games). But Zynga has also branched out from just the
Facebook platform, producing the ever-popular _Words with Friends_ mobile
application. Yet, the bulk of the company’s future success remains correlated
with Facebook.

But it is not an unrequited relationship: it was recently noted that almost
**10%** of Facebook’s revenues came from the fees paid by Zynga. This seems to
also be born out by the speculations in financial markets, valuing Facebook at
$100 billion and Zynga at approximately $10 billion. To have 10% of revenue
come from a single company seems to be somewhat risky.

With regards to Zynga, I’m still having trouble accepting that they got
millions of people to spend real dollars on **digital** cows and corn. But it
is clear that they’re really onto something and it will be really exciting to
watch it’s trek through the IPO and onto the markets.
