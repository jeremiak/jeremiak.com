[jeremiak/OAuth v1 Request Signing](https://gist.github.com/jeremiak/6369555):

I really enjoy OAuth 2.0. I think its clean, simple and easy Â to use in a
multitude of use cases.

However, I was trying to better understand how OAuth 1 signed requests. I
wanted to make sure I understood exactly how the signature was generated so I
wrote a quick script that does the same thing and makes authed requests
against Twitter.
