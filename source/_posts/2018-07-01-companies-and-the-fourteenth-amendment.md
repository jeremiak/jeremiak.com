title: Companies and the 14th amendment
---

Even before the last few, terrible Supreme Court decisions and before Anthony Kennedy announced that Donald Trump will nominate another Justice, the Court has been on my mind a lot because I'm reading "We the Corporations: How American businesses won their civil rights" by Adam Winkler. He chronicles the history of the ever expanding rights granted to corporations by the Supreme Court. If anything, it has highlighted to me that businesses have long been exploiting any avenue their lawyers can find to fight against government power. And that while the _very shitty_ Citizens United decision was made recently, the judiciary has long given rights society grants to people to companies.

My understanding of "corporate personhood" is that it is granted because of the 14th amendment, drafted originally to grant rights to former slaves. And given that Citizens United was just a few years ago, it surprised me to learn that companies have been exploiting the 14th amendment almost since immediately following its ratification. And then again, it didn't surprise me in the least. Companies have the funds and the lack of morales to seek creative (and frequently successful) legal approaches that leverage anything available to give them more power, and profits.

Winkler cites a finding from a long dead law librarian for Congress about the types of parties
