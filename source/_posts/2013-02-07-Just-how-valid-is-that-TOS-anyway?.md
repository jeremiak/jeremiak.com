I’m finally getting around to churning through some of my saved Pocket posts
and came across a TC post from late December titled "[Instagram Hit With Class
Action Lawsuit Related To Last Week’s Change Of Service
Terms](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/24/instagram-hit-with-class-action-
lawsuit-related-to-last-weeks-change-of-service-terms/)” and it got me
thinking.

Of course everybody has thought to themselves “who even reads these things” as
we check “I agree” to any of the multitudes of services we use in a given day.

AND, if nobody reads them does that mean we’re signing our collective digital
personas away to be monetized through personal ads or affiliate revenue?

Likely. Though I'm not so sure that behavior by mainstream digital services
will be looked so favorably upon by the American judicial system. Actually, I
have no real way of knowing that either but this class action lawsuit against
Instagram on behalf of its users will definitely set the industry tone going
forward on how binding a TOS is as well as how one must articulate and
maintain those terms.
