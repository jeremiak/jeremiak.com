The Crime Data Explorer makes nationwide crime data accessible to a wide range of users. View trends, download bulk datasets, and access the Crime Data API for reported crime at the national, state, and agency levels.

I was the technical lead on the project and was responsible for ensuring high test coverage across the React codebase, automated deployments, advocating for the use of Service Workers and server side rendering to improve end user performance. I was also responsible for managing all of our releases.
