name: Redistricting maps for CalMatters
order: 15
---

I worked with reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/SameeaKamal">Sameea Kamal</a> to create a series of maps that were used to illustrate one of the most confusing topics in elections: redistricting.

I used animated maps to show change over time and chose focal areas that were both relevant to the story and had particularly interesting changes.
