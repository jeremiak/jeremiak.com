    <p class="mt2">Election Confessions is an interactive application that allows anybody to submit a "confession" during the course of the 2020 presidential campaign and allows other readers to get a sneak-peak into the minds of their fellow voters.</p>
    <p>I was the principal technical architect of the application, designing a system that recognized our organization constraints (such as not having a production-ready database) to create a data pipeline that enabled readers to submit a confession, an editor to moderate the content, and then a website for the public to read and sort the confessions.
    <p>The project won a <a href="https://winners.webbyawards.com/#/2020/social/social-content-series-campaigns/news-politics-series-campaigns/120618/election-confessions">Webby Award</a> in 2020.</p>
